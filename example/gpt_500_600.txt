Section 202 of the Social Security Act stipulates that benefits are paid for the month before the one in which a beneficiary dies, meaning no payment is made for the month of death itself. This provision has been part of the law since 1939 and does not apply to Medicare, which covers benefits until the date of death.  Social Security benefits are issued on a monthly basis, with checks (or direct deposits) sent in the following month. For instance, January's benefit is paid in February. This system is known as retrospective payment. If a beneficiary dies late in the month and their family or the estate executor fails to notify the Social Security Administration (SSA), the check may be returned by the SSA.  Members of Congress frequently receive requests to support legislation aimed at providing benefits for the month of death. The following section outlines common arguments for and against such payments.  Critics argue that withholding a benefit for the month of death does not make practical sense, as expenses do not cease with the beginning of a new month. Moreover, the deceased beneficiary’s family or estate is responsible for funeral and burial costs. These critics often highlight how an individual who dies on the last day of the month receives no benefit for that month, whereas someone who dies just after midnight in the next month would receive full benefits for January. This discrepancy is seen as unfair by many.  They contend that the current policy is cruel to individuals already grappling with the loss of a family member and argue that the circumstances under which a check must be returned are incomprehensible. Those affected often question why someone’s final days matter more than their last month, given they have likely incurred expenses throughout most of the month. Critics also challenge how such a policy could have been established, perceiving it as an anomaly in Social Security design. If intended to reduce costs, they argue it is ineffective and perhaps even misguided.
Critics argue that the current policy discredits the system by giving the impression of arbitrariness, inflexibility, and thoughtless bureaucracy. They advocate for paying benefits at least for the portion of the month during which the beneficiary was alive. Meanwhile, supporters contend that providing full benefits for the entire month of death would be excessively costly; SSA estimates such payments would cost $1.6 billion annually. An alternative approach—paying 50% if the beneficiary dies in the first half of the month, and a full benefit if they die in the second half—would cost around $1.2 billion annually. Pro-rating benefits based on the number of days the beneficiary was alive during the final month would amount to roughly $800 million annually.  Additionally, SSA analyzed a proposal where a full benefit for the month of death would be paid to a surviving spouse (without requiring them to have lived with the deceased or been entitled to benefits), or a pro-rated benefit based on the number of days the beneficiary was alive during their final month. This proposed change could increase benefit payments by $13.2 billion over ten years.  Supporters argue that the current system pays benefits from the first day an individual becomes entitled, which offers a rough balance for not paying for the month of death. Survivor benefits are also payable starting with the deceased’s month of death, and eligible family members may receive a Social Security lump-sum death payment of $255. They assert that there is minimal awareness of the administrative challenges and potential costs involved in determining who should receive the beneficiary's monthly benefit posthumously. SSA would need to investigate each case and possibly split payments among multiple beneficiaries, making the process labor-intensive and complex.
Each house of the United States Congress is constitutionally empowered to discipline its Members for misconduct, a power the Senate has historically exercised through measures such as censures, restitution costs, and expulsion. This legislative discipline is administered via rulemaking powers, as explicitly outlined in Article I, Section 5, clause 2: "Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member." The primary rationale behind such discipline is to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legislative institution and proceedings rather than merely punishing individuals. Such internal processes complement any potential criminal or civil liabilities arising from misconduct.  Senators can be subject to internal congressional discipline for conduct deemed inappropriate by the Senate. The constitutional authority enabling this was influenced by British parliamentary practices and early colonial experiences, reflecting the principle that while Members of Congress are intentionally given minimal qualifications to ensure broad voter discretion, they must still adhere to certain privileges and decorum. This includes expelling a duly-elected Member if necessary.  Historically, Senate committees have recommended censure or expulsion resolutions to the full body, but often no action was taken due to various reasons such as subsequent elections, resignations, or inaction by the Senate itself. The Senate has also delegated its ethics oversight to the Select Committee on Ethics, which can investigate improper conduct and recommend disciplinary actions including issuing private or public letters of admonition without further Senate approval.
This report focuses on disciplinary actions taken by the full Senate against its Members. Expulsion is the procedure whereby the Senate (or the House) removes a Senator (or Representative, in the case of the House) from membership by a two-thirds vote, following their taking of the oath of office. The Constitution's Article I, Section 5, clause 2 explicitly grants this authority to each house of Congress.  Historically, parliamentary practices in England influenced this constitutional provision, allowing Members of the House of Commons to be expelled for various offenses or perceived unfitness for membership. It is important to distinguish expulsion from exclusion; exclusion refers to the Senate's refusal to seat a Member-elect based on grounds such as failing to meet constitutional qualifications (age, citizenship, and residence) or not being "duly elected," which requires a simple majority vote.  The authority of the Senate to exclude a Member-elect was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Powell v. McCormack, stating that the Constitution does not permit the House or Senate to exclude a duly elected representative who meets all constitutional requirements for office. Precedents from the Senate prior to the 1969 Powell v. McCormack decision, which evaluated moral character and past misconduct in exclusion proceedings, are now considered less relevant as precedents due to changes in legal understanding.
According to Deschler's Precedents, "The Powell decision apparently precludes the practice followed on numerous occasions during the 19th and 20th centuries, where Members-elect were excluded for prior criminal, immoral, or disloyal conduct." The Constitution does not impose any explicit limitations on the authority to expel a Member of Congress, aside from the two-thirds vote requirement. One study summarizing the Framers' intent noted that "the history of Article I, Section 5, clause 2, and in particular its course in the Committee of Detail, clearly indicates that the Framers ... did not intend to impose any limitation on Congressional power to determine what conduct warranted expulsion." The debates in the Constitutional Convention also suggest no desire to impose substantive restrictions on the expulsion power.  Justice Joseph Story similarly concluded that it would be "difficult to draw a clear line of distinction between the right to inflict the punishment of expulsion and any other punishment upon a member, founded on the time, place, or nature of the offense," suggesting that expulsion may be for any misdemeanor inconsistent with the trust and duty of a Member. The Supreme Court, citing Justice Story's treatise on the Constitution, found an expansive authority and discretion within each house of Congress concerning the grounds and timing for expulsion. In In re Chapman, the Court noted support from the Senate expulsion case of William Blount, which established that either house may punish a Member for conduct inconsistent with their trust and duty, even if not statutable or committed during a session.  The Supreme Court has thus recognized very broad discretion and authority in each house to discipline its Members under self-defined standards, generally without judicial review. In United States v. Brewster, the Court described the congressional disciplinary process as lacking "the panoply of protective shields" present in criminal cases; an accused Member is judged by unspecified standards and at the mercy of the charging body's unbridled discretion.
Precedents in the House cannot be regarded as controlling since it is not a continuing body. A thorough examination of congressional precedents suggests that while there has been some doubt about the "right" of the House to expel a reelected Member for past misconduct, known by his constituents, opinions on this issue are divided. For instance, during the Credit Mobilier investigations in 1872's 42nd Congress, two different House committees had conflicting views regarding the expulsion or censure of Representatives Ames and Brooks. However, when adopting a resolution of censure rather than expulsion, the House explicitly rejected a preamble that questioned its authority to expel for past misconduct. Similar disagreements emerged in other cases.  In modern congressional practice, and considering Supreme Court rulings and opinions, it appears more accurate to say that restraint in expelling reelected Members stems from questions about the wisdom of such policies rather than formal recognition of an absence of constitutional power to expel for past misconduct. The reluctance of either the House or Senate to expel a Member after reelection by his constituents, who are aware of his conduct, reflects respect for the popular will and election choices of the people.  Justice Story emphasized that while it is necessary to expel Members "who disgrace the House," such power should be used sparingly and wisely guarded by a two-thirds requirement. Similarly, Cushing argued that the expulsion power should be guided by strict justice, as expelling a duly-elected Member without just cause would assume control over the constituent by the representative body, contradicting election freedom.  In 1807, Senator John Quincy Adams discussed in a select committee report on a proposed expulsion of Senator John Smith for alleged involvement in the Aaron Burr conspiracy, the issues concerning the Senate's authority to expel even after an indictment had been dropped.
In the earliest Senate censure cases, as noted by historians and parliamentarians, no specific terms of disapproval such as "censure," "condemn," or "denounce" were used in the final resolutions. Instead, the 1811 resolution stated that Senator Pickering had "committed a violation of the rules of this body," while the 1844 resolution found Senator Tappan to be "guilty of a flagrant violation of the rules of the Senate and disregard of its authority." During the discussion of the 1844 censure, a Member of the Select Committee noted that the absence of explicit disapproval in the 1811 case was intended as a mild form of censure. In contrast, Senators Bingham of Connecticut (1929) and McCarthy of Wisconsin (1954) were explicitly "condemned" by the full Senate. The terms "censure" and "condemn" were used interchangeably in other cases: Senators McLaurin and Tillman of South Carolina (1902), Thomas Dodd of Connecticut (1967), Senator Talmadge (1979), and Senator Durenberger (1990) were all "denounced" by the Senate. Both "condemn" and "censure" have been used in two censure resolutions—those from 1929 and 1954—and were perceived to be substantially synonymous during those periods.  In the case of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Select Committee recommended that he be "censured" for two charges. However, the floor discussion revealed a nuanced use of language; when asked about the difference between "censure" and "condemn," Senator Watkins of Utah responded that modifying one section to include both terms would remove the word "censure."
The Committee report did not explicitly explain why the Talmadge matter was distinguishable from past cases or whether it deemed "denounce" stronger or weaker than "censure" or "condemn." However, in his additional views, Senator Schmitt argued that these terms—such as "reprehensible" and "denounced"—are essentially equivalent to "censured" or "condemned," but were used because only a "gross neglect" of duty by a Member was found, while the actual wrongdoing occurred due to staff. He noted that words like "reprehensible" and "denounced" lack historical precedents but are now viewed as equivalent in meaning to "censured," applied to cases where financial duties have been grossly neglected over years of illegal activities by subordinates.  Thus, even though the Committee did not use the term "censure," it nonetheless applied words defined in terms of "censure" to Senator Talmadge's misconduct. The Senate report suggested that using "denounce" acknowledged mitigating circumstances and recognized that the improprieties were not committed willfully or with actual knowledge by the Senator, hence avoiding the stronger term "censure."  The Senate Select Committee on Ethics did not explicitly justify its use of "denounce" over "censure" or "condemn" in the resolution for Senator Durenberger. The special counsel's report indicated that the precise verb is less important than the Committee’s characterization in a formally adopted resolution. During the Senate deliberations, an amendment to substitute "censure" for "denounce" was defeated, with Senator Lott of Mississippi arguing that "denounced" was intended as a lesser term due to mitigating circumstances and lack of venal intent.  Questions about the meaning of "denounce" were directed to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics, Senator Heflin of Alabama.
The Chairman of the Committee explained that the term "denounce" used in the censure resolution was within the broader definition of "censure," similar to an explanation given by the McCarthy censure committee. The term "denouncement," which originated from a former Georgia Senator, was considered equivalent to censure under Parliamentarian guidance. Some felt it weaker than censure, while others saw it as stronger; ultimately, its meaning depended on interpretation.  The Senate's action in adopting the resolution through formal adoption of the word "denounce" was within the bounds of the broader term "censure." The major aspect is that the Senate acts to express displeasure and disapproval, regardless of whether the language used is denouncement, censure, or condemnation.  Individually, each person can assign their own meaning and connotation to these terms. It falls within the broad parameters of the word "censure."  The Constitution allows either house of Congress to expel a member by a two-thirds majority without specifying reasons but also states that they may punish members for disorderly behavior. Early commentators felt this authority was limited to cases of disorderly or unruly conduct, as it disrupts the institution.  However, in congressional practice, censure has been recognized and accepted as extending to misconduct outside Congress if found reprehensible and reflecting discredit on the institution. This is similar to how the House of Representatives views its authority to discipline members through expulsion or censure, taking a broad view on matters that bring disrepute to the Senate or House.
In the 63rd Congress, the House Judiciary Committee described the power of the House to punish for disorderly behavior as "full and plenary," subject only to certain limitations, such as expulsion requiring a two-thirds vote. In their report on Representative Adam Clayton Powell, the House Select Committee noted that censure has been deemed appropriate in cases where there is a breach of the privileges of the House. There are two classes of privilege: one affecting the collective rights and safety, dignity, and integrity of the House's proceedings; and the other involving individual Members' rights, reputation, and conduct in their representative capacity.  Most cases of censure have involved unparliamentary language, assaults on a Member, or insults to the House through offensive resolutions. However, five cases in the House and one in the Senate (as of 1969) were based on corrupt acts by Members, with another Senate case involving noncooperation with and abuse of committees.  The Constitution vests this discretionary power to punish for disorderly behavior in the House of Representatives. The exercise of such authority is appropriate when a Member has been guilty of misconduct related to their official duties, noncooperation with committees, or unofficial acts that could bring disrepute to the House. Additionally, under the Senate's express Constitutional authority and its own Rules and precedents (Article I, Section 5, clause 2), censure can extend to misconduct or improprieties not necessarily violating a specific statute or written rule of ethical conduct. Even when such acts do not violate particular laws or rules, they may be grounds for censure if they are found contrary to "acceptable norms of ethical conduct," "good morals," or "senatorial ethics."  Before 1968, there were no written Senate ethics rules. The drafting and existence of a code of conduct in the Senate Rules for the first time that year did not preclude the continued application of unwritten standards or norms of ethical behavior against which a Senator's conduct could be judged.
In the House of Representatives, precedent exists for requiring a member who has been censured to present themselves at the bar of the House for a public reprimand by the Speaker. This practice has never been adopted in the Senate. We opted against using "reprimand," as it is considered too mild and lacks substantial meaning. Instead, we chose "censure," which we believed was the mildest term with legislative significance and would appropriately reflect the Senate's stance on an issue.  For instance, when Senators Tillman and McLaurin were censured by the full Senate in 1902 for fighting on the Senate floor, the committee recommended a resolution that "censured" them. The committee explained that while reprimand was deemed insufficiently severe given the nature of their actions, censure adequately condemned the behavior without resorting to expulsion.  Historically, prior to the 1970s in the House of Representatives, terms like "reprimand" and "censure" were often used interchangeably in resolutions.
In 1921, a resolution adopted by the House instructed the Speaker to summon Representative Blanton of Texas to the bar of the House "to deliver to him its reprimand and censure." More recently, however, the distinction in the House has evolved such that a "reprimand" is seen as less severe than a "censure," involving only an adopted resolution rather than a verbal rebuke. In contrast, a "censure" typically requires the Member to stand at the well of the House for the Speaker to read the resolution aloud.  In the Senate, a censure resolution is simply adopted and does not necessitate the Member's presence at the well. A resolution that includes "reprimand" in the Senate would thus follow similar procedures as a formal "censure," potentially blurring the lines between the two terms. Although there is no historical precedent for using "reprimand" in this context, such a term might be perceived by the public as a lesser form of institutional disapproval compared to "condemn," "censure," or "denounce."  The Senate's Select Committee on Ethics can also issue "reprimands" in reports or letters without full Senate vote. For instance, in 1991, such a reprimand was issued regarding Senator Cranston and the "Keating Five" investigations. The committee deemed the senator's conduct deserving of their strongest possible sanction and issued a strong and severe reprimand. While this reprimand was reported to the full Senate for discussion, no formal action was taken by the body.
Under the current rules governing the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, the Committee may issue a "letter of admonition" if it determines that an ethics violation is "inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature," and such public or private letter "shall not be considered discipline."   1. William Blount of Tennessee: On July 8, 1797, Blount wrote a private letter to a United States Government interpreter seeking his aid in a plan to seize Spanish Florida and Louisiana with British and Indian help. After a preliminary inquiry, a select committee found that Senator Blount's conduct was inconsistent with his public duty, amounted to a "high misdemeanor," and recommended expulsion. The report was adopted 25 - 1.  2. James M. Mason and Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia; Thomas L. Clingman and Thomas Bragg of North Carolina; James Chestnut, Jr. of South Carolina; A.O.P. Nicholson of Tennessee; William K. Sebastian and Charles C. Mitchell of Arkansas; John Hemphill and Louis T. Wigfall of Texas: On July 11, 1861, the resolution of expulsion was introduced on July 10, 1861, recognizing that some individuals were attempting to withdraw certain states from the Union and that they "are in arms against the Government." The resolution charged these Senators with failing to appear in their seats, aiding the Government during this critical period, and being engaged in a conspiracy to destroy the Union or acting with full knowledge of such a conspiracy. The resolution was adopted 32 - 10.  3. John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky: On December 4, 1861, the resolution of expulsion provided that Breckinridge "has joined the enemies of his country and is now in arms against the Government he had sworn to support." The resolution was adopted 37 - 0.  4. Jesse D. Bright of Indiana: In February 5, 1862, Bright was charged with writing a letter in 1861 recommending an arms manufacturer to Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, which potentially demonstrated disloyalty to the United States. Although the Judiciary Committee recommended against expulsion, the full Senate voted to expel him 32 - 14 after a lengthy debate.  5. Waldo P. Johnson of Missouri: On January 10, 1862, the resolution of expulsion was referred to the Judiciary Committee which found that Mr. Johnson's failure to take his seat at the beginning of the session and his failure to rebut allegations and indications of disloyalty to the Union provided strong presumptive grounds against his fidelity to the Union.
The expulsion resolution for Trusten Polk, a Senator from Missouri, was adopted by a vote of 35-0 on January 10, 1862. The Judiciary Committee reported that Polk had written in a secession newspaper supporting Missouri's joining "her Southern sisters," had failed to present himself at the beginning of the session to address implications of disloyalty to the Union, and had secretly left for the Confederacy. Similarly, on January 2, 1811, Thomas Pickering of Massachusetts was expelled by a vote of 36-0 after he read confidential documents from the French Minister during Senate sessions with open doors, violating the rules of the body. The resolution was adopted despite an amendment attempting to characterize his act as "unintentional." Benjamin Tappan of Ohio was also expelled on May 10, 1844, by a vote of 38-7 for delivering confidential documents to the press. Finally, John L. McLaurin and Benjamin R. Tillman from South Carolina were declared in contempt of the Senate on February 28, 1902, after Tillman struck McLaurin, resulting in a fight that required separation by others. The matter was referred to the Committee on Privileges and Elections for further action, with both Senators barred from recognizing each other without permission from another Member and approval by a majority of the Senate.
The Committee on Privileges and Elections convened and proposed a resolution of censure for Senator Hiram Bingham (Connecticut) due to "disorderly behavior and flagrant violation of Senate rules during the open session." This resolution also declared that the Senators were "censured for breaching the privileges and dignity of this body," and an order of February 22, which found them in contempt, was deemed no longer effective. On February 28, 1902, the resolution of censure, which amounted to a six-day suspension, was adopted by a vote of 54-12.  In November 4, 1929, a special subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee investigated allegations against Senator Hiram Bingham. The investigation concerned his employment practices, particularly his placement on the Senate payroll for an individual who served as a paid employee for the Manufacturers Association of Connecticut, which had a direct interest in tariff legislation. This person also gained access to secret committee deliberations due to his position. While the subcommittee report did not find any violation of law or Senate rule, the full Judiciary Committee chairman introduced S.Res. 146, condemning Bingham's actions as "contrary to good morals and senatorial ethics" and tending to bring the Senate into disrepute. This resolution was passed by a vote of 54-22.  On December 2, 1954, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (Wisconsin) faced similar scrutiny from the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections of the Rules and Administration Committee. An investigation began in 1951 and 1952 concerning his conduct during an election and since being elected to the Senate. Initially, McCarthy sought to charge his accuser formally but later challenged the investigation as a "design" to expel him for exposing Communists in government. Although no disciplinary action was recommended by the subcommittee, it criticized McCarthy for deliberately obstructing the investigation. In 1954, S.Res. 301, amended to include 46 counts of alleged misconduct, was introduced and referred to the Select Committee to Study Censure. This committee examined censure in various categories, including contempt of the Senate and obstruction of the legislative process. The final report (S.Rept. 2508) documented these charges but did not result in a formal censure.
After a floor debate, the full Senate voted to censure McCarthy on two counts: non-cooperation with and abuse of the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections in 1952, and abuse of the Select Committee to Study Censure. The modified resolution was adopted by a vote of 67-22, with Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut presiding on June 23, 1967. The Senate's Select Committee on Standards and Conduct investigated McCarthy for allegations of unethical conduct, including his relationship with a private businessman in West Germany; the conversion of campaign contributions to personal use; the free use of loaned automobiles; and the acceptance of double reimbursements from both the Senate and private sources. The committee recommended censure over the use of campaign funds for personal purposes and the double reimbursements. Despite no law or Senate Rule prohibiting such use at that time, it was found that McCarthy had improperly used proceeds from testimonial dinners, which were deemed political in nature, thus failing to uphold the public trust. On October 11, 1979, Senator Herman E. Talmadge of Georgia was censured after the Senate's Select Committee on Ethics found him responsible for financial irregularities such as excess official reimbursements and inaccurate financial disclosures. The committee concluded that Talmadge either knew or should have known about these acts and omissions, and thus was grossly negligent in his duty to administer his office.
As noted earlier, the Senate's formal adoption of a resolution disapproving of a Member's conduct through "denouncing" their actions is categorized as a "censure" by historians and parliamentarians. Expulsions in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have historically been reserved for the most severe misconduct, typically involving disloyalty to the government or convictions (or evidence) of official corruption and misuse of power. Other than expulsion, a formal censure is the strongest statement of disapproval that the Senate can invoke against one of its Members. In addition to a censure, the Senate may also require financial restitution from the Member, limit specific privileges, or recommend a reduction in seniority status within the party conference.  While there are no automatic penalties following a censure, public reprobation and formal rebuke by peers in the Senate have reportedly affected the re-election prospects of some Senators. The full U.S. Senate formally adopts a resolution disapproving of a Senator's conduct through a vote requiring a majority of Members present and voting, which is considered a "censure" by parliamentarians and historians.  There are no specific technical requirements for the wording in a censure resolution, nor an official hierarchy or ranking of terms used. The Senate has censured its Members using various verbs such as "condemning," "censuring," or "denouncing," along with resolutions that do not include any term of opprobrium. In practice and perception, however, the verb "condemn" in a censure resolution may be considered more severe than "censure," due to its association with disciplinary actions against Senator Joseph McCarthy. Meanwhile, "denounce" might imply a less severe form of censure when mitigating circumstances are present.  Censure authority extends to misconduct that may or may not violate an express statute or written Senate ethics rules.
Politics in Haiti have been marked by violence and authoritarianism since its independence in 1804 following a slave revolt against French colonial rule. Between the end of Toussaint Louverture's leadership in 1803 and the fall of Francois Duvalier’s 30-year dictatorship in 1986, numerous despotic rulers emerged. This legacy has proven difficult to overcome. Additionally, traditional centers of power such as the military, religious institutions, business sector, and the elite have viewed democratic reforms skeptically due to their threatening nature in Haiti's context. The government apparatus still primarily comprises Duvalierist appointees who have resisted change through numerous post-Duvalier governments.  Haiti’s history is characterized by conflicts between the mulatto elite and the majority black population. Most Haitians are poor, illiterate peasants of African descent. Mulattos established their economic power and status largely through control over the business sector. Both groups held periods of political dominance; black rulers emphasized Haiti's African roots and traditions, including Voodoo, while the mulatto elite favored a European, Catholic tradition.  Recent improvements in race relations include the acceptance of the Creole language as an official language used by all Haitians, common interracial marriages, and a reduction in the government’s reliance on mulattos. However, recent political events have heightened racial and class tensions, with the poor black majority relying on public protests for access to power. The mulatto elite wields significant economic and political influence and resists substantial changes aimed at wealth redistribution.  Much of this century has been marked by foreign intervention in Haiti. In 1915, the United States intervened to halt civil strife and prevent German encroachment, with over 2,000 U.S. Marines stationed there by mid-August. The Marines stayed until 1934, overseeing public works, tax collection, treasury management, and establishing Haiti's first professional military force. While some contributions were appreciated, the U.S. presence was widely resented as an affront to Haitian sovereignty, with many accusing the U.S. of favoring mulattos over blacks.  By 1932, under President Herbert Hoover’s administration, the U.S. began withdrawing from Haiti.
President Hoover appointed a commission in 1930 to examine U.S. involvement in Haiti due to growing concerns about its impact. The commission found that while the occupation had brought material improvements, it also excluded Haitians from significant governmental and constabulary roles. Under President Franklin Roosevelt, a disengagement agreement was signed in August 1933, and the last contingent of U.S. Marines left Haiti in August 1934.  Francois Duvalier, known as "Papa Doc," became president in 1957 through elections marred by numerous irregularities. Initially running on a platform promising political liberty and social reform, Duvalier quickly established himself as a dictator. Arbitrary imprisonment, torture, and unexplained deaths became common under his rule. The Tontons Macoutes, or "bogeymen," his private militia, carried out most of the repression. These loosely organized armed gangs were used to eliminate opposition through violence and extortion while countering the army's power.  In 1964, Duvalier amended the constitution to secure a president-for-life position. In 1971, he further amended it to name his 19-year-old son Jean-Claude as president-for-life three months before his death. During the 1980s, "Baby Doc" Duvalier's marriage to a prominent mulatto and their lavish lifestyle fueled resentment among Haiti’s impoverished black majority. Fiscal corruption was rampant under his rule. As popular dissatisfaction grew, so did repression. Facing massive protests and international pressure, Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country for France on February 7, 1986, with U.S. encouragement.  Following his departure, a military-dominated National Council of Government (CNG) disbanded the Tontons Macoutes and allowed the drafting of a new constitution. The constitution, approved by over 99 percent of voters in a plebiscite, guaranteed personal liberties, distributed power among a president, prime minister, and two legislative houses, transferred police to the department of justice, and created an independent electoral council for overseeing civilian elections starting in February 1988. Those associated with the Duvalier family dictatorship were barred from running for office.
But Duvalierists, in collaboration with the army, thwarted the November 1987 elections through a violent campaign that resulted in the deaths of numerous voters; as a consequence, the elections were suspended. In January 1988, the CNG conducted its own elections, widely perceived as rigged in favor of Leslie Manigat, an exiled academic. However, less than six months later, on June 20, 1988, Manigat was overthrown by a military coup after he attempted to replace officials and reform the government. Lt. General Henri Namphy, CNG president and a close friend of Papa Doc's, assumed power. During his 31-month tenure (February 1986 to September 1988), human rights violations increased, marked by numerous political killings. Namphy was succeeded by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who promised a transition to democracy but continued to violate human rights, as reported by the U.S. State Department and other organizations. Violent popular protests led to Avril's resignation after 18 months. Consequently, in March 1990, a civilian government was appointed with the mandate of holding elections as soon as possible. A coalition of political and civic organizations selected Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the only woman on the Supreme Court, as provisional President. The State Council was established to provide policy guidance to the executive branch but severed relations after the executive branch failed to consult or act against political violence. President Trouillot led a generally weak civilian government that struggled to control the military effectively. She established and cooperated with an independent electoral council that organized successful elections at year-end.  Hopes for Haiti's transition from authoritarian rule were raised on December 16, 1990, when Haitians elected a president, national legislators, and municipal officials in elections estimated to have had a 70% voter turnout. International observers declared the elections generally free and fair despite security concerns and lack of democratic tradition. These elections resulted from a strong democratic movement that emerged in the late 1980s, supporting an elected government that would establish order non-repressively. The movement included various societal elements such as political parties, peasant and labor organizations, human rights groups, and professional associations. Many observers also credited the success and relatively peaceful nature of the elections to international observer presence and economic support from numerous nations and organizations.  Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected President with 67.5% of the vote and was inaugurated on the fifth anniversary of the Duvalier dictatorship's collapse.
A 37-year-old populist Roman Catholic priest, he was the most controversial candidate among the 11 eligible for the presidential race by the independent Provisional Electoral Council (CEP). To his supporters, Aristide is a martyr who risks his life to defend the poor. An advocate of "liberation theology," Aristide publicly opposed Duvalier and subsequent military rulers. In September 1988, an armed group attacked and burned his church, killing 13 and wounding 70; however, he escaped unharmed surrounded by his parishioners. To his detractors, Aristide is a potentially dangerous demagogue whose inflammatory speeches allegedly incited the "dechoukajes," or "uprooting" of suspected Tontons Macoutes by angry mobs. Aristide reportedly denied that his book, 100 Verses of Dechoukaj, condones violence; however, the Salesian religious order expelled him for preaching politics from the pulpit, including what they called "class struggle."   When Aristide became a candidate, he toned down his revolutionary and anti-U.S. rhetoric. Previously, Aristide opposed democratic elections in Haiti, arguing that free and fair elections were impossible as long as Duvalierists held economic and political power. Nevertheless, he joined the race to counter Roger Lafontant's potential candidacy. Lafontant was ruled ineligible for the presidency and attempted a coup against President Trouillot in January 1991 to prevent Aristide from taking office on February 7, 1991. The army arrested Lafontant, who instead declared martial law; however, crowds lynchingly attacked and killed suspected Macoutes, burning down the 220-year-old cathedral as an apparent retaliation for a tense homily by the Archbishop warning of authoritarian politics.  Many foreign diplomats criticized Aristide for not condemning the street violence quickly or forcefully enough. During his 8 months in office, President Aristide faced some of the most serious and persistent social, economic, and political challenges in the Western Hemisphere. He was credited with reducing crime in the capital, streamlining state enterprises, and bringing the military under civilian control. However, observers questioned the new government's commitment to democracy. Neither Aristide nor his Prime Minister belonged to a political party, and other politicians criticized him for not fostering cooperation among democratic elements. Many legislators protested his appointments of Supreme Court judges and ambassadors without consulting the Senate as required by the constitution.
Aristide agreed to consult the legislature but relations between the two remained strained. He was criticized for his attitude towards the judicial system. In July 1991, Lafontant was tried for his role in a failed January coup attempt and received a life sentence, despite the constitution limiting sentences to 15 years. The following day, Aristide declared it a national holiday.  The trial was met with concern as it lasted over 20 consecutive hours, lacked key witnesses, and appointed five trainee lawyers due to perceived dangers for Lafontant's regular counsel. Initially criticized for lacking a clear plan, the Aristide government presented a macroeconomic reform and public sector investment plan in July 1991 to representatives from several nations and international lending institutions, who praised the plan and committed $440 million in FY1992 aid. Most of this aid was later suspended following the September 30, 1991 coup.  In terms of human rights, Aristide faced mixed reviews. He was criticized for seemingly condoning mob violence but also credited with reducing human rights violations during his tenure. Some believed that by refusing to condemn violent acts of retribution and threatening mob violence against dissenters, Aristide polarized the situation in Haiti. For instance, he publicly endorsed "pere lebrun," a practice where someone is burned alive using an oil-soaked tire.  Aristide's September 27, 1991 speech threatened former Tontons Macoutes with this same practice while also hinting at similar threats against the bourgeoisie for perceived insufficient support. In exile, Aristide later condemned necklacing. Observers argue that his speech also targeted the bourgeoisie, threatening them with the same violence if they did not assist his government adequately.
Some viewed Aristide's speech in support of Pere Lebrun as contributing to his eventual overthrow just days later, with reports from Americas Watch and two other human rights organizations highlighting that members of the bourgeoisie were reportedly financially backing both Aristide and his wife. In their report on the Aristide government’s human rights record, they noted that while Aristide's advocacy for lawful redress was overshadowed by his support for Pere Lebrun, he had a duty to refrain from any statements supporting this practice and to firmly oppose it. Failure to do so marred his human rights record.  The report also aligned with the views of many in the international community, recognizing Aristide as the "sole legitimate Haitian head of state" elected with a two-thirds majority, an uncommon mandate in the region. It asserted that while acknowledging the need to address the human rights shortcomings of Aristide's government, these failings should not justify depriving the Haitian people of their right to elect their own government.  Most human rights monitors credit Aristide’s administration for being the first to focus on improving respect for human rights and addressing the needs of Haiti’s poor majority. They claim that progress made during his term was undermined by the subsequent military regime, which restored a sense of security in Haiti not seen in years. Under Aristide, common crime significantly decreased in cities, and removing long-standing rural sheriffs improved security across the countryside. State Department reports from 1991 and 1992 noted no disappearances during his tenure, but this situation changed dramatically after he was ousted, with a significant increase in political killings.  The September 1991 coup occurred just four days after Aristide addressed the United Nations, marking for him what he claimed would end Haiti’s dark era of dictatorship. The State Department estimated between 300 and 500 deaths during the coup, while Amnesty International reported over 1,500.  During military-dominated interim governments, the Haitian army often hindered democratic processes. However, after the last military dictator left in March 1990, some believed the army had transformed into one supportive of democracy. Throughout the 1990 electoral process, the 7,000-man army proved capable of maintaining order.
Crime is typically regulated by local laws and subject to prosecution within the jurisdiction where it occurs. However, American criminal law extends beyond U.S. borders under specific circumstances, particularly for crimes that span multiple jurisdictions. State-level prosecutions abroad are largely confined to such multi-jurisdictional offenses, where some elements of the crime take place within the state while others occur outside its boundaries.  Numerous federal criminal statutes possess extraterritorial application, though actual prosecutions remain rare due to practical and legal complexities, as well as potential diplomatic concerns. The U.S. Constitution does not bar Congress or states from enacting laws applicable beyond national borders, nor does it prevent either the federal government or state authorities from prosecuting offenses committed abroad. Several constitutional provisions hint at such extraterritorial application: "felonies committed on the high seas," "offences against the law of nations," and commerce with foreign nations.  Specifically, Congress is granted the authority to define and punish felonies and piracy on the high seas and to regulate foreign commerce. Additionally, the Necessary and Proper Clause enables Congress to enact laws necessary for executing these powers. This clause has historically been cited as a basis for enacting extraterritorial criminal legislation primarily in maritime contexts.  The Commerce Clause, particularly its provision for regulating foreign trade, supports congressional power to create criminal statutes with extraterritorial application. While the other two components of this clause—regulating interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes—are also significant, their extraterritorial implications are less clear. Recent judicial interpretations have generally favored a more moderate approach in determining the scope of these powers.
For instance, although the Constitution reserves most governmental powers not explicitly granted elsewhere to the states, the federal government's preeminence in foreign affairs restricts state authority primarily to areas where they act with federal authorization or acquiescence. In terms of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the most commonly cited limitation stems from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Although enumerated powers might impose specific constraints on exercising such authority overseas, traditionally, it is the general restrictions of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause that have been used to delineate the outer bounds of enacting and enforcing legislation with extraterritorial application.  Unfortunately, many cases merely note that due process limitations define the boundaries for enacting and enforcing American law abroad. This limited insight diminishes when considering that the situations most likely to necessitate such due process analyses often involve the least required process. U.S. courts hearing overseas violations of American law must operate within due process constraints, but the Supreme Court has noted that constitutional due process protections do not extend to aliens without significant voluntary connections to the United States. Additionally, recent Supreme Court decisions often assume extraterritorial jurisdiction does not carry constitutional implications.  Nevertheless, due process issues have begun to appear in a growing number of lower court rulings related to extraterritoriality. Some courts require a nexus between U.S. interests and the circumstances of the offense, occasionally relying on international law principles or personal jurisdiction minimum contacts tests to determine this requirement. At the core of these cases is the idea that due process mandates that a defendant's actions must have some past, present, or anticipated connection to the United States before they can be fairly held criminally liable in an American court.  Commentators have approached this analysis with caution, and some courts have outright rejected it. A related due process challenge focuses on notice requirements, similar to concerns over secret laws and vague statutes, which undermine the traditional maxim that ignorance of the law is no defense.
Indicia such as knowledge, reason to know, an obligation to know, or reasonable ignorance of the law's requirements—some reflected in international standards—are pertinent factors. For example, citizens should be expected to know their nation's laws; seafarers, the laws of the sea and their home country's legislation; everyone must be aware of the laws of the land they are in and the wrongs condemned by all nations' laws. However, applying American criminal statutes to an alien in a foreign country where the conduct is lawful might indicate insufficient notice, raising due process concerns. Despite this, courts generally hold that questions of extraterritoriality are primarily within Congress's discretion; granting a statute extraterritorial application, regardless of policy consequences, is not constitutionally suspect. Therefore, determining how far U.S. statutes apply outside the country has typically been seen as a matter of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation.  General rules of statutory construction have emerged to explain or predict these outcomes. First, if a statute does not address overseas application, it will be construed to apply only within the United States unless there is clear evidence suggesting otherwise. Additionally, when a statute permits some extraterritoriality, the presumption against such applications limits it strictly according to its terms.  Traditionally, the second rule stated that the nature and purpose of a statute could indicate whether Congress intended it to apply beyond U.S. borders. This was first clearly articulated in United States v. Bowman. However, Morrison's strong domestic presumption in a civil context cast doubt on Bowman’s relevance. Early reactions suggested courts and commentators were hesitant to fully adopt this position. The Supreme Court's decision in RJR Nabisco, another civil case, might have altered this stance. Here, the Court seemed directly addressing Bowman without explicitly naming it, potentially questioning its continued validity.  The final rule posits that unless a statute clearly indicates otherwise, Congress is presumed to have acted to avoid actions inconsistent with international law.
At one point, it appeared that cases suggested another rule: unless Congress explicitly stated an intention for a statute to apply overseas to both foreigners and U.S. citizens, it would generally be presumed to apply only to Americans. However, as discussed further below, this presumption may seem less compelling in light of the broad interpretation of international grounds upon which one can base claims. International law does not dictate but rather supports decisions regarding the extraterritorial application of American laws. Neither Congress nor courts are bound by international law when enacting or interpreting statutes with overseas implications; however, international law is considered when evaluating policy issues tied to legislation that may have global consequences.  Congress interprets legislation under a presumption that it intends its laws to align with international law unless indicated otherwise. The extent of a nation's extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction can largely be determined by national interests—what interest does the country seek to protect, and what are the implications for other nations?  The common classification of these interests traces back to a 1935 Harvard Law School study, which identified five principles: (1) the territorial principle, covering crimes occurring within or impacting a nation's territory; (2) the nationality principle, addressing crimes committed by nationals abroad; (3) the passive personality principle, involving offenses against its citizens; (4) the protection principle, focusing on crimes that affect national interests; and (5) the universal principle, dealing with universally condemned crimes.  The American Law Institute’s Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States provides a comprehensive modern statement on international law. It suggests that reasonableness sets the limits for a nation's extraterritorial enforcement of its laws, balancing interests as identified in the Harvard study principles. While the Restatement's views hold significant weight with both Congress and courts, they traditionally assess the extent to which international law would recognize an extraterritorial application by considering these principles broadly.  The territorial principle extends beyond mere geographic boundaries, encompassing conduct within a nation’s jurisdictional reach.
Extraterritorial jurisdiction encompasses laws governing conduct within territorial waters, aboard vessels in international waters, actions partially occurring within geographical boundaries, and activities elsewhere with impacts on the territory. Congress frequently indicates a statute's intended application within its territorial waters and vessels through the text. Although rarely explicit, courts have consistently recognized an "impact" basis for extraterritorial claims, especially when international law principles support it. The protective principle extends beyond its title to crimes committed abroad against national security, territorial integrity, or political independence, allowing statutes to apply internationally to protect federal interests. For instance, it covers the murder or attempted murder of federal officers, acts of terrorism targeting U.S. foreign policy, behaviors deemed threats to national security, false statements or forgery aimed at obstructing immigration law enforcement, stowaways entering the country, and bribery related to federal contracts abroad.  The nationality principle bases extraterritorial jurisdiction on the accused's citizenship, as exemplified by the Blackmer v. United States case involving an American living in Paris who defied a court order. Cases invoking this principle often intersect with others like the protective or passive personality principles. The passive personality principle asserts jurisdiction based on the victim’s nationality, commonly applied when other legal principles align. The universal principle allows any nation to punish offenses against international law, such as piracy and crimes committed on stateless vessels in international waters.  Congress's explicit declaration that a statute applies outside U.S. borders is perhaps the clearest indication of intent for extraterritorial jurisdiction.
Congress has explicitly provided for the extraterritorial application of federal criminal law, most often through legislation that prohibits various forms of misconduct occurring "within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States." This concept, though the phrase may be newer, traces back to the First Congress and includes navigable waters, federal enclaves within the U.S., and areas beyond its territorial limits. Initially, the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction encompassed primarily state-like legislative jurisdiction over certain places, U.S. navigable waters, and vessels of the United States; however, it has been statutorily expanded to serve as a basis for the extraterritorial application of various federal criminal laws related to: air travel (special aircraft jurisdiction), customs matters (customs waters of the U.S.), U.S. spacecraft in flight, stateless submersible vessels on the high seas, overseas federal facilities and residences of federal employees, members of the U.S. Armed Forces stationed abroad and their accompanying family members, human trafficking, and sex offenses committed by federal employees or U.S. military personnel abroad.  A second category of explicit extraterritorial federal criminal statutes derives from obligations and principles established in international treaties, conventions, or agreements to which the United States is a party. The application of these treaty-based crimes varies; some are applicable only when the offender is an American citizen, while others cover misconduct so universally condemned that they fall within U.S. jurisdiction regardless of other factors, as long as the individual flees to the U.S., is brought there for prosecution, or is otherwise "found in the United States" after committing the offense. Still, some enjoy extraterritorial application under a variety of explicit jurisdictional circumstances.  A third category includes statutes that either cryptically state their provisions are to apply overseas or describe a series of jurisdictional circumstances where they have extraterritorial effect, often involving the foreign commerce of the United States in conjunction with other factors. The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) is somewhat unique as it authorizes extraterritorial coverage based solely on the consent of the nation with primary criminal jurisdiction. MDLEA prohibits the manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute controlled substances aboard vessels within U.S. jurisdiction and defines such vessels broadly, encompassing not only ordinary U.S.
Maritime jurisdiction under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) extends beyond U.S. waters, covering the maritime zones of other countries with their consent. This definition also includes "vessels without nationality," or stateless vessels, for which no national registry claims jurisdiction. MDLEA serves as the legal foundation for Coast Guard drug interdiction efforts in the Caribbean and off the coasts of Central and South America. Courts have ruled that MDLEA is a valid exercise of Congress's constitutional authority to define and punish felonies on the high seas and offenses against international law, though they differ on whether a nexus between the U.S. and the offense must be shown and on how the act's jurisdictional determinations should be handled.  Until the decisions in Morrison and RJR Nabisco, lower courts interpreted Bowman and Ford to mean that numerous other federal crimes apply overseas due to Congress's implied intent. These courts construed Bowman and Ford as suggesting broad American extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction, including statutes designed to protect federal officers, prevent smuggling, and deter the obstruction or corruption of U.S. activities abroad.  For instance, lower courts have held that the statute prohibiting the assassination of Members of Congress can apply to an American committing such a crime in a foreign country. Similarly, laws against the murder or kidnapping of federal law enforcement officials can be applied extraterritorially even if the offenders are not Americans and even if they mistakenly believed their victims were federal officers.  The courts have also extended extraterritorial jurisdiction to cases where aliens attempt to defraud the U.S. for admission, false statements made by Americans overseas, theft of federal property abroad, counterfeiting or misusing federal documents or checks, and murder of foreign nationals intended to facilitate criminal activities in the U.S.  The decisions in RJR Nabisco cast significant doubt on these interpretations, especially without textual, structural, or contextual indications that Congress intended such statutes to apply abroad. This skepticism applies equally to earlier legal precedents, as they might also suggest a broader application than intended by Congress.
There appeared to be no compelling reason why statutes safeguarding the United States from intentional deprivation of its property through destruction should be treated differently from those involving theft. However, the RJR Nabisco Court did support implied extraterritoriality for "piggyback" offenses such as conspiracy, attempt, and aiding and abetting, whose provisions inherently depend on another crime. Earlier cases occasionally suggested that an individual could still be guilty of conspiracy to violate a U.S. federal law, even if they never entered the country, as long as they were part of a conspiracy aimed at violating American law. The same rationale was applied to accessories aiding overseas federal crimes and "piggyback" offenses where criminal liability hinged on acts committed abroad. The RJR Nabisco Court seemed in agreement: "Congress's inclusion of these (and other) extraterritorial elements in RICO clearly indicates that [RICO's prohibitions] extend to foreign racketeering activity—but only to the extent that the alleged predicates themselves have extraterritorial application."  State criminal laws are less likely than federal laws to apply overseas, as state statutes generally were not explicitly designed for international application and their territorial limitations could frustrate legislative intent. The Constitution assigns primary responsibility for protecting American interests abroad to the federal government. While the primacy of federal authority in foreign affairs might imply that states cannot enact laws governing conduct outside U.S. borders, courts and commentators have recognized a limited state power to legislate extraterritorially. Congress can preempt state legislative action in areas where it has full jurisdiction, and treaties binding on the United States also restrict state legislative authority. However, absent federal legislation, the question of whether states intended to legislate extraterritorially is more pertinent than their capacity to do so.  States have chosen to extend their laws beyond their borders only in limited circumstances, typically where there is a clear connection to the state.
State statutes often assert extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction when some elements of an offense are committed within the state, while others occur outside its borders. Another common assertion is that individuals committing or conspiring to commit crimes within the state from abroad, or vice versa, fall under this jurisdiction. Some states also claim jurisdiction if a homicide victim dies within their territory after being fatally wounded elsewhere; if stolen property is brought into the state; or if actions taken outside the state constitute non-compliance with state-imposed legal duties.  Despite numerous federal statutes that have undisputed extraterritorial reach, and many others believed to have apparent extraterritorial jurisdiction, few prosecutions have actually occurred. Legal, practical, and often diplomatic obstacles can make these investigations challenging for law enforcement.  According to the Restatement, state sovereignty dictates that officials from one state may not exercise their functions in another state without its consent. This means that while a state can implement certain non-judicial measures against someone abroad, its law enforcement officers cannot arrest them or conduct criminal investigations without permission. Failure to respect these boundaries can lead to strong diplomatic protests and other remedial actions.  Congress has supported international cooperation through mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs). The United States currently has over 70 MLATs in effect, which facilitate the exchange of information and support for state and federal investigators via the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs. These treaties originally aimed to overcome restrictions imposed by foreign bank secrecy laws but now commonly include provisions for locating individuals or items, serving legal processes, executing search warrants, taking witness depositions, and facilitating voluntary testimony from foreign nationals.  Witness depositions can be taken abroad using letters rogatory, which are formal requests for judicial assistance in gathering evidence.
Letters rogatory involve formally requesting another country's courts to obtain a witness's statement on behalf of one's own court. This procedure is governed by statute and follows specific rules. Often, it serves as a last resort due to its complexity and the discretion involved with foreign courts. U.S. law enforcement has traditionally employed less formal cooperative methods overseas for investigating and prosecuting extraterritorial crimes. Over recent decades, efforts have been made to enhance cooperation. This includes an increased presence of federal civilian law enforcement agencies abroad; for instance, the Justice Department's Criminal Division now has resident legal advisors in 45 countries, while the FBI operates legal attache offices in 78 foreign cities, and similar offices are present in 92 cities run by the DEA, 75 locations managed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and 20 by the Secret Service. Some regulatory agencies with law enforcement duties also cooperate with their foreign counterparts. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has 105 similar entities abroad, is a signatory of the International Organization of Securities Commissions' multilateral memorandum of understanding for enforcement cooperation.  Congress has enacted measures to facilitate foreign law enforcement efforts here in exchange for reciprocal treatment. Notably, the Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act of 2009 allows Justice Department attorneys to seek various orders from federal judges to assist investigations by foreign authorities, including search warrants, access to stored communications, pen register or trap and trace orders, and subpoena authority.  Abroad, search and seizure activities can have Fourth Amendment implications. The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez clarifies that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches of foreign nationals' property outside the U.S., unless they have significant connections with the country. The application of the Fourth Amendment to U.S. citizens and those with strong ties to the U.S. remains less clear, particularly before the Verdugo-Urquidez decision, when neither the Fourth Amendment nor its exclusionary rule was considered applicable in overseas contexts, except under specific circumstances.
The first exception covered foreign conduct that "shocked the conscience of the court," while the second addressed foreign searches or seizures where U.S. law enforcement officials were sufficiently involved to be considered part of a "joint venture." These exceptions were rarely explained in terms of their applicability, often focusing on U.S. nationals' person or property. Due to the scarcity of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) in earlier times, these exceptions were seldom invoked by courts.  Since the Verdugo-Urquidez decision, U.S. courts have generally held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches or seizures conducted abroad by foreign officials against U.S. citizens, though they continue to recognize rare "joint venture" and "shocked conscience" exceptions. Prior to Verdugo-Urquidez, lower federal appellate courts largely agreed that the Fourth Amendment applied when U.S. law enforcement officials searched or seized the property of U.S. citizens abroad.  Now, the key question is what standards the Fourth Amendment demands in such situations. Typically, a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate based on probable cause is required for reasonable searches and seizures within the United States. However, exceptions exist where no domestic authority authorizes a warrant.  In Verdugo-Urquidez, concurring opinions suggested that the warrant requirement does not apply to U.S. officials conducting searches abroad. Nevertheless, "the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard applies to U.S. officials conducting a search affecting a U.S. citizen in a foreign country." Such searches are reasonable if they comply with foreign law and can be upheld under the good faith exception when U.S. officials reasonably rely on foreign authorities.  Similarly, the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination clause and its Miranda warning requirements do not apply to statements made abroad to foreign officials, except for "joint venture" or "shocked conscience" cases. In contrast, these provisions apply if American officials conduct custodial interrogations of any defendant anywhere in the world. Finally, any confession or incriminating statement must be freely given and is subject to a five-year statute of limitations for federal crime prosecution.
Federal capital offenses, certain federal sex offenses, and various violent federal terrorist offenses can be prosecuted at any time. Nonviolent federal terrorism offenses must commence within eight years. Additionally, the statute of limitations is suspended or tolled during periods when the accused is a fugitive. Regardless of the applicable statute of limitations, Section 3292 permits the federal courts to suspend it if evidence from a foreign country is requested and deemed necessary. Upon the U.S.'s application before an indictment, indicating that such evidence is in another country, the district court will suspend the statute of limitations if it finds by a preponderance of evidence that an official request has been made and reasonably believes such evidence exists in that country. The suspension period can last up to six months if the requested foreign assistance arrives before the statute would otherwise expire, or up to three years in other instances. It starts with the filing of the foreign assistance request and ends when the foreign government acts upon it. The government must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the overseas evidence is relevant to the case. Despite these time limits, there's no requirement for showing diligence in gathering this evidence.  The use of Section 3292 has been contentious, with circuits divided on whether it can revive a statute of limitations after it has expired or extend it for evidence already received. At least one circuit interprets "the district court before which a grand jury is impaneled to investigate the offense" as merely identifying the court that may issue the suspension order and not limiting its application to pending grand jury investigations.  Extradition, the oldest form of international law enforcement assistance, involves treaty-based surrender of fugitives for prosecution or sentencing. The U.S. has bilateral extradition treaties with approximately two-thirds of the world's nations.
Treaties negotiated before 1960 and still in effect reflect the view held by the U.S. and other common law countries at that time, which considered criminal jurisdiction territorial, thus not allowing for extradition of individuals involved in extraterritorial crimes. Subsequent treaties either mandate extradition regardless of where the offense is committed or permit it if the laws of both nations are compatible. More recent agreements address traditional complications in earlier treaties, such as nationality and political offense exceptions. Federal crimes committed abroad are typically carried out by locals; however, most treaty provisions stipulate that neither party should extradite its own citizens or subjects. Recent treaties often include an article stating that extradition cannot be denied on the basis of nationality or require referral to local authorities for prosecution if it is. The political offense exception, originally intended to protect unsuccessful insurgents, now includes both purely and relatedly political offenses, sometimes conflicting with efforts to combat terrorism. Modern treaties frequently limit this exception and include provisions for refusing politically motivated extradition requests. Prior U.S. extradition treaties from the 1980s onward typically list specific crimes covered by the treaty, ranging from murder and forgery in early treaties to over 30 types of crimes by the end of the 20th century. More recent treaties opt for broader descriptions instead. Alternatively, foreign authorities might be willing to expel or deport suspects who are not citizens, allowing U.S. authorities to take them into custody under certain circumstances.
Mutual legal assistance treaties and similar agreements typically include provisions for facilitating the transfer of custody of foreign witnesses imprisoned abroad or for eliciting cooperation from foreign nationals willing to testify voluntarily within U.S. borders. When it is impossible to secure a witness’s presence, Federal Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows federal courts to authorize depositions taken outside the United States under exceptional circumstances and in the interests of justice, provided that the demands of the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause are met.  Originally, only defendants could request depositions under Rule 15, but prosecutors have been allowed to do so since the 1970s. The rule offers depositions as an alternative to long-term incarceration of material witnesses; otherwise, they may be ordered only in exceptional circumstances. To establish such circumstances, a party must demonstrate the witness’s unavailability and the testimony's materiality. Some courts would also require showing that the testimony is necessary to prevent a failure of justice or add other considerations.  Depositions are generally taken under the same procedures as those in civil cases. The rule mandates that defendants be afforded an opportunity to attend depositions ordered by the government, with the court preferring that defendants be present and allowed to cross-examine witnesses. Verbatim transcripts and videotaped recordings are preferred but not always required. In nations where such conditions might otherwise be lacking or prohibited, treaty provisions can address deposition procedures.  The U.S. government will typically take depositions under conditions allowing them as evidence at trial, though compliance with Rule 15 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for admissibility. The ultimate question of admissibility turns on whether Confrontation Clause requirements are met. This clause guarantees not only the right to a face-to-face confrontation but also the opportunity to cross-examine and expose the witness's demeanor to the jury.  The early cases relied heavily on Supreme Court decisions, including Ohio v.
In the case of Maryland v. Craig, the Supreme Court considered whether trial witnesses could testify remotely via a two-way video conference. It ruled that under certain limited circumstances, such as considerations of public policy and necessity, the Confrontation Clause's requirement for physical face-to-face confrontation between witness and defendant at trial can be waived.  In contrast, in Roberts v. Harris, the Court addressed whether the admission of hearsay evidence violated the Confrontation Clause. It held that if the hearsay evidence falls within a "firmly rooted" exception, its use in criminal trials does not violate the clause.  However, Crawford v. Washington overturned these precedents by determining that "testimonial" hearsay could only be admitted into evidence with the safeguard of cross-examination. Crawford specifically prohibits reliance on the Roberts' blanket exception for hearsay, particularly when dealing with testimonial depositions or similar forms of out-of-court statements.  Craig's video testimony and public interest exception remains somewhat ambiguous. While one appellate panel suggested that the prosecution's need for critical evidence alone does not justify a Craig exception, another held that national security interests could qualify. Pre-Crawford cases required efforts to ensure the defendant’s attendance at overseas depositions, implying that this might be necessary under Crawford as well.  Notably, in a subsequent case involving video testimony, the Fourth Circuit dismissed a Confrontation Clause challenge when the deposition met both criteria: denial of face-to-face confrontation due to important policy considerations and assurances of reliability through an "oath, cross-examination, and observation of the witness's demeanor."  The Federal Rules of Evidence govern admissibility in federal criminal trials. A deposition taken overseas that has been scrutinized under Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Confrontation Clause is likely to be deemed admissible. The primary obstacle lies with Rule 802, which reflects a preference for evidence exposed to adversarial testing.
The Rule, however, explicitly allows for depositions, including those taken abroad under its authority. When witnesses and evidence are located in other countries, a defendant's statutory and constitutional rights might conflict with the government’s need for secrecy to protect diplomatic or national security interests. Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants defendants access to their statements in the government's possession, but this may be problematic if the prosecution's case originated from foreign intelligence gathering. The Sixth Amendment ensures that a criminal defendant has the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses and the right to confront witnesses against them, even those presenting classified information. Congress addressed these conflicts with the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), which permits courts to approve prosecution-prepared summaries of classified information as substitutes.  These summaries must adequately replace the classified information because the government’s national security interests cannot override a defendant's right to a fair trial. There is also a statutory procedure to facilitate the admission of foreign business records in federal courts, covering "foreign records of regularly conducted activity" in any form, including memoranda, reports, and data compilations maintained abroad. These documents are exempt from the hearsay rule under federal criminal proceedings and can be authenticated with foreign certification. The process also allows for challenging the reliability of these documents as part of pre-trial motions.  While a prosecution's failure to provide timely notice of intent to rely on this section does not automatically bar admission, its lack of foreign certification prevents such admission. Early appellate decisions supported Section 3505 in light of Confrontation Clause challenges, such as those involving depositions that drew support from Ohio v. Roberts. However, Crawford casts doubt on the continued applicability of the all-encompassing Roberts rule, emphasizing that actual confrontation is required for "testimonial" hearsay.
Although Crawford did not provide a thorough definition of testimonial hearsay, it did note that "most hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial—for example, business records." This distinction has been cited by several court panels to reject confrontation clause challenges to Section 3505.

Since the establishment of the modern U.S. intelligence community following World War II, neither Congress nor the executive branch has publicly disclosed the total extent of intelligence spending beyond two fiscal years in the 1990s. Instead, intelligence programs and personnel have been largely contained within the Department of Defense (DOD) budget without being specifically identified. This practice has long faced criticism from advocates of open government. The mid-1970s reform effort aimed at greater congressional oversight also produced several proposals to disclose intelligence spending figures publicly.  Many observers argued that with the end of the Cold War, the need to keep total intelligence spending secret diminished. They noted that few foreign countries could effectively use such information to develop countermeasures, and terrorist organizations lacked the capability to exploit comprehensive spending data. In recent years, there has been renewed consideration for making overall intelligence spending totals public.  In 1991 and 1992, legislation was enacted stating "the sense of Congress" that aggregate amounts for intelligence and related activities should be disclosed publicly in an appropriate manner. However, both the House and Senate did not require the release of such data in subsequent years. During the Clinton Administration, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet twice initiated the release of total figures for appropriations, but no further disclosures were made after fiscal years 1997 and 1998.  The issue has persisted. The 9/11 Commission recommended that overall intelligence funding amounts should no longer be secret and suggested a separate appropriations act to clarify the allocation of tens of billions of dollars among various intelligence efforts. Some 2004 intelligence reform proposals included provisions for public budgeting, but these were not included in the ultimately enacted Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458). More recently, the FY2007 Intelligence Authorization legislation included similar recommendations.
The Senate report from January 2007 (372) mandates the publication of budget totals for national, but not tactical, intelligence programs. This document details the components of the intelligence budget, historical practices concerning intelligence authorizations and appropriations, arguments both for and against making intelligence spending public, a legal analysis of these issues, and an examination of post-Cold War developments' implications. It also highlights past congressional interest in maintaining secrecy over intelligence spending totals.  The term "intelligence budget" is complex and not easily defined; it often encompasses agencies and functions across the federal government involved in intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination, yet does not include all relevant funding, such as reporting by U.S. embassies to the State Department. Additionally, there are separate categories of intelligence-related activities within the Department of Defense that contribute to overall intelligence spending.  For certain purposes, intelligence and related activities can be described as those authorized by annual intelligence authorization acts. In the context of annual budget reviews, both the executive branch and Congress have sought a comprehensive overview of all intelligence collection systems and activities, leading to the concept of an intelligence community—a grouping of governmental entities ranging from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and National Security Agency (NSA) down to small intelligence offices in departments such as Treasury and Energy.   Excluding the CIA, this community comprises components that are integral parts of agencies not themselves part of the Intelligence Community, with their budgets subject to separate authorization processes. For example, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research is both a member of the intelligence community and an organizational component of the State Department; its budget is considered part of the overall intelligence budget as well as the State Department’s budget.  Similar situations exist on a much larger scale in the Defense Department. Given the close ties between these intelligence components and their parent departments, it is often challenging to precisely segregate intelligence and non-intelligence costs. For this discussion, the U.S. "intelligence budget" is considered to consist of activities authorized by annual intelligence authorization acts.
The United States government's intelligence and related activities are conducted by the following elements: (1) the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (2) the National Security Agency (NSA); (3) the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); (4) the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), formerly known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA); (5) the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO); (6) intelligence elements of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps; (7) the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR); (8) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (9) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); (10) the Coast Guard; (11) the Department of the Treasury; (12) the Department of Energy; and (13) the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The parameters of the intelligence budget are somewhat arbitrary, as there can be fine lines between intelligence activities and other information-gathering efforts. For instance, reporting by State Department Foreign Service Officers is an invaluable supplement to intelligence but does not fall under the category of intelligence activities. Similarly, some reconnaissance and surveillance missions, primarily conducted within the Department of Defense (DOD), are closely akin to intelligence operations for practical purposes, though they have historically been classified differently.  The current division of the intelligence budget by Congress is into two parts: the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). NIP programs, formerly known as the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP), are conducted by agencies like the CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA, primarily supporting national-level decision-making. MIP programs are carried out by DOD agencies to support defense policymaking and military commanders globally.  Before September 2005, there were two sets of programs within DOD: the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) and Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA). JMIP focused on broader DOD-wide activities established in 1994. TIARA encompassed a range of reconnaissance and target acquisition programs integrated into the basic military structure, providing direct support to military operations.  In recent years, there has been increased overlap between intelligence and related activities. Satellite photography, for example, can now be rapidly made available to tactical commanders. Tactical-level intelligence is often transmitted to national-level agencies. As a result, JMIP and TIARA were consolidated into the MIP by the Defense Department in September 2005.  Within the MIP are programs formerly part of the JMIP that support DOD-wide intelligence efforts, as well as those directly supporting military operations from the TIARA category. The relationship between these intelligence-related and regular intelligence programs is complex and not widely understood.
James Woolsey characterized these activities as a "flexible and diverse set of efforts that can vary from year to year based on the strategic decisions made by different military services regarding tactical intelligence." Intelligence-related programs, accounting for approximately one-third of overall intelligence expenditures, are an integral part of defense initiatives; often, they also receive support from non-intelligence personnel and facilities. For example, the administrative costs of a military base with dual intelligence and non-intelligence functions would likely not be included in intelligence budgeting. The role of these programs is occasionally misunderstood in public discussions of the multi-billion-dollar intelligence effort.  Following the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has substantial statutory authority to develop and determine the National Intelligence Program (NIP), submitting it for presidential approval. The President then forwards the NIP as part of the annual budget submission in January or February each year. The Office of the DNI (ODNI) acts as the DNI's staff for preparing and submitting this budget. Additionally, the DNI is involved in developing the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) with the Secretary of Defense. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) oversees all defense intelligence budgetary matters to ensure compliance with the DNI’s budget policies for the NIP. As the MIP's program executive, the USD(I) also coordinates during the programming, budgeting, and execution cycles.  Both the Office of the DNI and the office of the USD(I) play essential roles in the development of both the NIP and MIP, with overlapping responsibilities necessitating close coordination. Congress has long faced challenges in budgeting for secret intelligence efforts. To address this, President Truman established the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) through a directive on January 22, 1946. The CIG was intended as a coordinating body comprising representatives from State, War, and Navy Departments with personnel and facilities provided "within the limits of available appropriations." However, concerns over legal authorization led to questions about the CIG's funding after January 22, 1947.  Shortly after assuming office in June 1946, General Hoyt S.
Vandenberg established a "working fund" from allotments in the Departments of State, War, and Navy under the Comptroller General's supervision to cover the costs of the relatively small Central Intelligence Group (CIG). It is unclear whether funds were transferred from all three departments; given their larger budgets, the War and Navy Departments may have been more likely contributors. Recognizing the administrative weaknesses in this setup, Vandenberg sought congressional approval for an independent intelligence agency with its own budget. The National Security Act of 1947, which established a unified National Defense Establishment, included provisions for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), headed by a Director of Central Intelligence. It authorized the transfer of personnel, property, and records from the CIG to the new CIA but did not provide additional statutory language regarding the administration of the CIA.  With the establishment of the CIA under the 1947 Act, arrangements were made for continuing funding mechanisms, with the Agency to follow normal procedures until further legislation by Congress specified otherwise. It was acknowledged that enabling legislation would be necessary. After some delays, Congress passed the Central Intelligence Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-110) to provide a firmer statutory base for the CIA and establish regular appropriation procedures. This law authorized the CIA "to transfer to and receive from other Government agencies such sums as may be approved by the Bureau of the Budget." Additionally, it stipulated that "sums transferred to the [CIA]... may be expended for the purposes and under the authority of this Act without regard to limitations of appropriations from which transferred."  Representative Carl Vinson stated in the House shortly after the 1949 Act's passage that the legislation provided the CIA with the authority to transfer and receive funds approved by the Bureau of the Budget. This was essential for operating an efficient intelligence service, as it concealed the required amount of money. In practice, the 1949 Act allowed the CIA to be funded through the defense authorization and appropriation process.
Funding for other intelligence activities conducted by Department of Defense (DOD) agencies was typically included in defense appropriations bills. For decades, authorizations and funding for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were managed by a few members and staff from the Appropriations Committees, with input from the Armed Services Committees. According to available sources, senior members of the Appropriations Committees maintained strict secrecy regarding the CIA's budget requests and congressional responses. In 1956, subcommittees were established within both the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees to oversee the CIA.  Many assessments of congressional oversight during the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson Administrations indicate that Congress largely played a supportive but perfunctory role in intelligence matters. However, recent analyses suggest that Congress was more actively involved in reviewing intelligence spending, particularly for major surveillance systems and construction projects. The few members responsible for oversight maintained close relationships with the CIA.  Beginning in the Eisenhower Administration, Senator Richard Russell served as both chairman of the Armed Services Committee and its Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations, significantly influencing intelligence funding. During the Cold War era, intelligence budgets grew substantially due to efforts to determine Soviet nuclear capabilities through overhead surveillance using aircraft like U-2s and reconnaissance satellites, and through extensive signals intelligence operations.  The National Security Agency (NSA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) emerged as major intelligence agencies with large budgets, while other entities were created for satellite launches and interpreting aerial photography. These capabilities played a direct role in the design of strategic weapons systems and negotiations of arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, costing billions of dollars.  President Lyndon Johnson stated on March 16, 1967: "I wouldn't want to be quoted on this but we've spent 35 or 40 billion dollars on the space program. And if nothing else had come out of it except the knowledge we've gained from space photography, it would be worth 10 times what the whole program has cost. Because tonight we know how many missiles the enemy has and, it turned out, our guesses were way off. We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor. Because of satellites, I know how many missiles the enemy has."  During the Ford Administration, Executive Order (E.O.)
On February 18, 1975, Executive Order 11905 consolidated budgets for all intelligence agencies and mandated a comprehensive review of the National Foreign Intelligence Program by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and senior Defense Department (DOD) and National Security Council (NSC) officials. Subsequent executive orders, including most recently E.O. 12333 from December 4, 1981, and the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-496), further clarified and enhanced the DCI's role. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) established a new position, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), with authority to coordinate intelligence activities across the government and manage the NIP. This act also specified that the DNI would develop and determine the annual consolidated NIP budget.  The DNI's responsibilities extend to participating in the development of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP), which remains under the purview of the Secretary of Defense. A critical factor driving this consolidation has been increased congressional oversight. In the 1950s and 1960s, efforts to establish intelligence committees or broaden oversight were met with resistance, maintaining oversight in the hands of a few senior members. After the Vietnam War, this situation changed. In response to revelations about illegal activities by intelligence agencies in 1975, Congress created two temporary select committees—the Church and Pike Committees—to investigate CIA operations and other intelligence entities.  These committees investigated a broad range of issues and conducted public hearings. While budgetary concerns were not central, it became clear that congressional oversight needed formalization and improvement. Public sentiment also favored greater transparency in intelligence matters. Following these investigations, Congress established permanent oversight bodies: the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) in 1976 and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in 1977. These committees were tasked with preventing abuses identified by the Church and Pike Committees.  Notably, HPSCI oversees both the NIP and shares oversight of the MIP with the Armed Services Committee. In contrast, SSCI focuses solely on the NIP. In the Senate, the Armed Services Committee has oversight over the MIP with informal cooperation from the intelligence committee.
Both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the Senate Armed Services Committee participate in conferences on intelligence authorization bills. The final bill, as reported by the conference committee, authorizes both intelligence activities and related activities.  The two intelligence committees are not the sole entities responsible for congressional oversight; the Armed Services Committees also issue sequential reports on intelligence authorization bills. Annual defense authorization acts incorporate large national intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense (DOD) along with the intelligence efforts of the four services. Intelligence activities outside of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and DOD are authorized through other legislation, although some departments have standing authorizations rather than annual authorization acts.  Like other congressional committees, oversight of intelligence involves reviewing administration-submitted budget proposals for the Intelligence Community, conducting hearings, preparing an annual authorization bill, and managing it for the respective chamber. The two committees publish reports that accompany the annual intelligence authorization bills, including dollar amounts for various intelligence agencies in classified annexes. These annexes are accessible only within Intelligence Committee offices, with strict sanctions against unauthorized disclosure.  However, the intelligence committees do not have exclusive jurisdiction over intelligence program expenditures; national defense authorization acts also contain authorizing legislation for such activities. Various parts of defense authorization bills remain classified, including "black" programs that encompass certain intelligence operations and procurement of new weapons systems like stealth aircraft. Members can obtain information on these classified sections from the Armed Services Committees.  Other authorization bills cover some intelligence activities, providing a form of shared oversight. Budgets for agencies such as INR (Bureau of Intelligence and Research), DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration), and the FBI are funded through appropriation bills covering the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, with similar procedures used for Treasury and Energy Department intelligence entities in the Energy and Water Development appropriation bills.  Despite this, these combined efforts represent a small percentage of total intelligence spending. For instance, the FY2007 budget request for INR totaled only $51 million, while other agencies were even smaller. Controversy has arisen regarding the specific nature of authorizing legislation required. Section 504(a) of the National Security Act states that funds may be obligated or expended for intelligence activities only if specifically authorized by Congress... However, the exact nature of such specific authorization had not been clearly defined until November 30, 1990, when President George H.W.
Bush exercised a pocket veto on the FY1991 Intelligence Authorization bill after it was presented to him when the 101st Congress had adjourned, leading to over eight months of continued intelligence activities without an authorization act. While some believed that authorizations within the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1991 (P.L. 101-510) were sufficient, the House Intelligence Committee stated that only a specific intelligence authorization bill meets the requirements of the statute. In 1993, the House report on the FY1994 Defense Authorization Act clarified that NFIP programs included in such bills are not considered specifically authorized under section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947. Additionally, Section 309 of the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization Act amended the National Security Act to explicitly state that general authorization does not satisfy specific authorization requirements for intelligence activities.  In years when appropriations precede final action on authorization bills, similar provisions have been included in appropriations acts. For instance, section 8092 of the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-148) deemed funds for intelligence activities specifically authorized by Congress for purposes of section 504 of the National Security Act during fiscal year 2006 until enactment of the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006. Since no FY2006 intelligence authorization bill was passed, this clause served as the requisite authorization. Similarly, the FY2007 defense appropriations bill (P.L. 109-289) included a similar provision in section 8083 when it was passed before consideration of an intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2007.  These provisions fulfill the statutory requirement for specific authorization but provide less detailed congressional guidance on intelligence programs compared to full authorization acts. As with all government activities, appropriations committees play a central role in intelligence programs.
During the Cold War era, despite minimal public attention on congressional oversight of intelligence activities, annual appropriations were still required, and extensive hearings were held. In recent years, appropriations committees have grown increasingly influential in shaping intelligence operations. For instance, in 1998, a supplemental appropriation act (P.L. 105-277) allocated additional funds for intelligence efforts not included in the annual authorization bill. Post-9/11, relying on supplemental appropriations for regular intelligence agency operations has limited congressional guidance over the budget.  This practice has faced significant criticism; the House Intelligence Committee noted that while supplementary funding addressed crises following terrorist attacks, "repeated reliance on such funding undermines strategic planning." The committee hoped that with adequate resources, long-term strategic planning could begin. In FY2006, a single paragraph (section 8092) of the defense appropriations act (P.L. 109-148) provided authorization for intelligence programs.  The use of supplemental appropriations and reliance on specific authorizations from section 504 of the National Security Act may alter congressional oversight by emphasizing the role of appropriations committees. The two defense subcommittees review intelligence budget requests, approving funding levels for agencies like CIA, NSA, DIA, NRO, and NGA, which are part of DOD or included in defense appropriations acts. Although the CIA and ODNI budgets fall under these acts, they are transferred directly to the DNI and CIA Director by OMB.  However, the Secretary of Defense remains heavily involved in intelligence agencies within DOD. The CIA and defense agencies account for most intelligence spending. Smaller amounts are allocated through other departments containing elements of the Intelligence Community. Appropriations committees can significantly impact these processes; for example, in 1992, the FY1993 Defense Appropriation Act (P.L. 102-396) reportedly reduced intelligence funding below the levels authorized by the Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 102-496).
From 1990 to 1991, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) collaborated to sponsor a facilities consolidation plan for certain CIA activities without significant involvement from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI). Since FY2006, intelligence programs have been substantially altered through appropriations measures. Because there is no dedicated intelligence authorization act in place, agencies rely solely on appropriations legislation.  Since the establishment of the modern Intelligence Community following World War II, intelligence budgets have remained undisclosed. After hostilities ended in August 1945, intelligence activities were transferred from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to the Army, Navy, and State Departments, which then assumed funding responsibilities. The costs for the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), established in 1946, required a "working fund," as detailed earlier, funded by allocations from these departments. This pattern continued with the CIA's creation in the following year, though there may have been few or no transfers from the State Department. Appropriated funds were transferred secretly at Congress members' insistence.  Several parts of the intelligence budget are disclosed annually: the costs for the Intelligence Community Management Account (CMA) and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS). The CMA includes staff support for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) role, while CIARDS covers retirement costs for CIA personnel not eligible for the government-wide system. For FY2005, $310.4 million was authorized for 310 full-time CMA personnel and $239.4 million was authorized for CIARDS.  Additionally, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research budget is disclosed publicly, though not all tactical intelligence programs are identified in unclassified Defense Department (DOD) budget submissions. Careful analysis of officially published data on intelligence expenditures would not provide a clear picture of the overall size and content of the intelligence budget.  The Church and Pike committees both advocated for public disclosure of each annual intelligence budget's total amounts. Then-DCI George H.W. Bush and President Ford opposed this, leading the Senate to refer the matter to the SSCI. In May 1977 (S.Res. 207, 95th Congress), SSCI recommended disclosing aggregate national foreign intelligence activity funding for FY1978 but the full Senate did not act on this recommendation.  The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) conducted an extensive study of disclosure after the Pike Committee's termination, guided by House Rule XLVIII.
Following hearings in 1978 and despite DCI Stansfield Turner's willingness to disclose "a single inclusive budget figure," the House Committee concluded unanimously that there was no persuasive public interest in disclosing any or all authorized funds for government intelligence activities. In the absence of legislative action, the disclosure question faded as efforts were made during the Carter Administration to draft a comprehensive legislative charter for the Intelligence Community. The Reagan Administration showed less interest in this issue and instead focused on expanding intelligence operations significantly. This issue resurfaced during the Clinton Administration post-Cold War and was again discussed in the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.  Since the 1970s, members of Congress have been able to review budget figures contained within classified annexes accompanying intelligence authorization bills, albeit under strict confidentiality rules that prevent the disclosure of such information. The arguments for and against public disclosure of intelligence spending levels center on fundamental constitutional issues regarding government expenditures transparency (discussed below), the value of open political discourse, the risks of revealing sensitive information to adversaries, and the challenges in discussing aggregate numbers without disclosing specific details.  Supporters of disclosure argue that greater public discussion of intelligence spending, facilitated by the disclosure of spending levels, could ultimately lead to a stronger intelligence effort. They maintain that no organization, even one with superior management and personnel, is immune to inefficiency, and that broader awareness of intelligence costs and benefits could contribute to organizational improvements over time.  For instance, Senator William Proxmire articulated this perspective as follows: "People not only have the right to know, but a more informed public will lead to a more efficient government. Improvements come from criticism, and you can only criticize effectively when you have information." Additionally, publishing an aggregate figure for intelligence spending would result in a clearer, more accurate defense budget.
Currently, the defense budget encompasses substantial unspecified national intelligence expenditures (e.g., a large portion of the CIA budget) that are often not strictly related to defense spending. These outlays can inflate the apparent size of the defense budget and its components. Identifying those intelligence expenses that do not align with defense objectives could offer the public a more precise understanding of actual defense costs.  Proponents of this view also argue that disclosing limited intelligence spending figures would provide no strategic advantage to adversaries. During the Cold War, they contend, Soviet authorities likely had a good grasp on the U.S. intelligence budget and were more concerned with the nature of our activities than their financial scale. In 1994, Representative Dan Glickman, then Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stated that unless national security justifies secrecy, withholding these figures only shields taxpayers from knowing how much is spent on intelligence.  Those opposing public release argue that intelligence inherently differs from other government operations and publishing general budgetary details could jeopardize U.S. intelligence capabilities by informing adversaries about our activities. They maintain that intelligence should be treated as a unique activity requiring extraordinary protective measures, particularly for operations involving sensitive reconnaissance technologies, electronic devices, and high-risk human resources. In 1983, HPSCI highlighted the vulnerability of intelligence systems: unlike weapon systems, which can only be countered over time, intelligence systems are susceptible to immediate compromise.  With the end of the Cold War and defense budget reductions, it was proposed that intelligence spending should also be significantly scaled back.
Some advocates of reduced transparency anticipated that publishing detailed spending figures might lead the public to perceive intelligence expenditures as unjustified, thus advocating for cuts. This potential for public resistance was acknowledged by many defenders of current spending levels, which likely reinforced their stance against disclosing budget details. While such perspectives were common in the early 1990s, international terrorism and other transnational threats later in the decade prompted concerns that further reductions could undermine intelligence capabilities. The September 11 attacks particularly underscored this, as despite criticism of intelligence performance, there was a strong determination to invest heavily in intelligence for the global war on terror.  In recent years, arguments for public disclosure have generally not been seen as a vehicle for reducing intelligence spending, given the acknowledged need for robust counterterrorism efforts. Critics argue that revealing total spending figures without context would be meaningless, necessitating detailed explanations that could reveal sensitive information to adversaries. They contend that such transparency might allow opponents to gain insights into U.S. intelligence activities and devise effective countermeasures.  On the other hand, some maintain that intelligence spending within the National Intelligence Program should be expressed as a percentage of total defense spending, suggesting a more strategic approach. Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who served as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence during the early Reagan Administration, proposed in 1991 that it would be appropriate to disclose the total amount and justify why 10% of overall defense spending on national and tactical intelligence was a reasonable goal.  Some opponents argue that significant variations in intelligence spending could also expose new programs under development. Premature disclosure of such capabilities could jeopardize their effectiveness by alerting adversaries to U.S. advancements before they were fully operational.
According to a 1991 Senate report, DCI Stansfield Turner testified in 1977 that there had been no "conspicuous bumps" in the intelligence budget over the preceding decade, and the Select Committee shared this view, believing that publishing annual aggregate budget totals since then would not compromise any secrets. Unconvinced defense analysts argue that revealing significant yearly changes in U.S. intelligence budgets could alert unfriendly governments or groups to new efforts against them (or expose a weakened effort they might exploit). Public debate on disclosing intelligence budgets often focuses on constitutional and propriety issues surrounding classified spending figures.  However, beyond these concerns lies the less-discussed issue of the nature of intelligence and related expenditures. While the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) have been publicly acknowledged in various Executive and Legislative Branch publications, their specific roles remain obscure outside a narrow circle of intelligence specialists. The role of tactical programs, in particular, is rarely considered when discussing public disclosure of spending levels.  Observers express concern that characterizing certain projects related to information support for targeting as part of the NIP could be seen as arbitrary if similar projects are included elsewhere in the Defense budget. Furthermore, it is reported that inclusion of some projects in the MIP program varies from year to year, which might cause confusion in tracking intelligence spending.  Some suggest making public only the budget for the NIP, which includes funding for the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (formerly NIMA), and the National Security Agency (NSA). When disclosing total NIP spending, some recommend consolidating responsibility for authorizing the NIP in the two intelligence committees while leaving the armed services to handle the MIP. Given that the NIP includes major defense agencies reporting to the Secretary of Defense and employing thousands of military personnel, it is likely that the jurisdiction of the Armed Services committees will continue.  In 2002, the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) was created by section 901 of the FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 107-314).
The incumbent, currently Stephen Cambone, oversees the budgets of DOD's intelligence agencies, including both National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Military Intelligence Program (MIP) components. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) serves as the key liaison between DOD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), collaborating in the preparation of annual budget submissions to Congress alongside other intelligence agencies.  One significant issue when considering whether to disclose an aggregate intelligence budget figure is whether the Statement and Account Clause of the U.S. Constitution mandates such disclosure. The relevant constitutional language, found in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7, states: "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time."   A brief historical examination of this language and the limited case law interpreting the Statement and Account Clause may help contextualize the disclosure issue. At the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, on September 14, 1787, George Mason proposed a clause requiring "that an account of the public expenditures should be annually published." Debate followed, with James Madison suggesting amending the proposal to "from time to time" instead of "annually," arguing that this would ensure frequent publications while allowing legislative discretion. This compromise was adopted by the convention, with "annual" struck out and "from time to time" inserted as a more flexible directive.
Mason amended the text, which was then agreed upon with no objection: "appropriations by law as follows—"And a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time." During the Virginia ratifying convention, this Statement and Account Clause sparked discussion at least twice. On June 12, 1788, James Madison noted: "The congressional proceedings are to be occasionally published, including all receipts and expenditures of public money, none of which can be used without an appropriation by law. This is a security we do not currently enjoy." He also mentioned that the part allowing for potential secrecy in matters like military operations or foreign negotiations was copied from the Articles of Confederation.  On June 17, 1788, George Mason raised concerns about "from time to time" language. The ensuing debate went as follows: Mr. GEORGE MASON believed the phrase "publication from time to time" was too vague and could apply to any period—monthly or every seven years. It might be extended indefinitely. He argued that while secrecy was sometimes necessary for military operations and foreign negotiations, the expenditures of public money should never be concealed from the people, who have a right to know how their funds are spent. Mason feared this ambiguity could allow permanent concealment and misuse of public funds.  Mr. LEE (of Westmoreland) dismissed such arguments as trivial. He deemed the phrase "from time to time" sufficiently clear and satisfactory, suggesting it meant short, convenient periods, just like specifying one year or a shorter term. Lee believed that those who neglected this provision would disobey explicit instructions. Given that the Assembly was to convene the following week, he hoped gentlemen would focus on investigating the main parts of the Constitution.  Mr. MASON insisted on using his accustomed mode of argumentation despite desiring to please Mr. Lee, as his duty must prevail over personal preferences.  Mr. GEORGE NICHOLAS asserted that this direction and security were better than what existed in the state government.
No appropriation of public funds shall be made except by law, ensuring no misapplication can occur. Thus, he believed such provisions deserved praise over censure, as they were a cautious measure rarely found in constitutions. Mr. CORBIN agreed with Mr. Nicholas's sentiments on this matter.  Mr. MADISON considered the clause superior to specifying any particular period for publishing accounts of public receipts and expenditures. Short intervals might not provide comprehensive or detailed information necessary for thorough comprehension and error detection. By allowing publication at times deemed convenient, the provision would offer fuller and more satisfying reports, though perhaps less frequent than specified periods.  He also noted that this clause exceeded what was found in any state constitution within the Union, if not globally. Mr. MASON responded by pointing out that under the Confederation, monthly publication of public proceedings was mandated, which he deemed preferable to relying on the virtue of officials for such disclosures. He suggested that the full representation in Virginia's assembly made it more trustworthy compared to this less adequate representation.  Mr. MADISON countered that the limitations experienced with the Confederation influenced his support for this clause. It was impossible to satisfactorily reconcile public accounts within short intervals. Mr. HENRY, addressing the House, observed that while there were intended restrictions in the 9th section, they resembled a bill of rights and set boundaries on Congress's powers. He questioned whether these provisions compared favorably to Virginia or other states' bills of rights regarding their comprehensiveness and protection.
The restraints in this congressional bill of rights are so weak and limited that it would have been better to say nothing about them. The implication is clear: Congress can do anything not explicitly forbidden by the Constitution. If Congress enacts a law that is not restrained by the 9th section, it will be considered an incidental power. A Virginia law in contradiction to this bill of rights would be invalid. The national wealth is to be managed under secrecy according to this paper, as the requirement for publication from time to time would be meaningless and could be concealed. In contrast, our state government's legislative proceedings are fully transparent; the journals are published daily and the lobby is filled with observers every day. Gentlemen claim that such partial transparency is a security not found in our state system. This regulation would be ineffective or at best unnecessary since the public already sees the legislature's journal and debates. You are assured your rights under this new government, but they are safeguarded only by the 9th section. The few restrictions within it are your sole protection; Congress could control your actions and words without conflicting with this document. Your most cherished privileges depend on Congress's consent, as they fall outside the 9th section’s constraints.  This concern was also addressed in the New York ratifying convention and the Maryland House of Delegates. In the New York debates on June 27, 1788, Mr. Chancellor Livingston highlighted that giving up state legislative powers would be harmful because Congress might misuse its power or squander public funds. However, he pointed out a critical check: Congress must publish their receipts and expenditures from time to time.
These may be compared year by year; if the former consistently exceed the latter, corruption will become apparent, and constitutional remedies can be sought accordingly. I urge the committee to consider that "from time to time" implies regularity, not necessarily a lengthy period such as centuries or decades. The Honorable Mr. Smith noted that this phrase might allow for infrequent disclosures, but the Chancellor argued that public representatives would prioritize transparency due to its impact on popularity and constituent satisfaction. Indeed, it is highly probable that representatives will ensure frequent and detailed financial statements are provided.  On November 29, 1787, delegates from the Constitutional Convention appeared before the Maryland House of Delegates to explain the principles underlying the proposed Constitution. James McHenry explained Section 9, emphasizing that public funds should only be drawn under legislative appropriation, a provision he believed would face no opposition as it ensured people knew how their money was spent.  This historical context highlights varying perspectives on transparency but does not extensively address potential secrecy in intelligence funding. The debate centered primarily on the necessity of such provisions, the timing and frequency of financial statements, and their practical implications. Notably, some delegates acknowledged possible temporary secrecy for specific operations like military or foreign affairs, but generally rejected the concealment of public expenditures.  The most explicit reference to secret financial disclosures is in McHenry’s remarks, where he discussed situations that might require confidentiality.
He viewed the clause's requirement for periodic publication as overly broad, allowing Congress the discretion to dispose of public funds in secret or to conceal information deemed necessary to remain confidential. The historical context of the clause suggests uncertainty regarding whether others shared his perspective. It is clear that concerns about the proper use of public funds were the driving force behind the inclusion of the Statement and Account Clause. This clause seemingly mandates a duty to disclose financial information related to government receipts and expenditures, but lacks specific guidance on the extent and frequency of such disclosures. Some indication exists that at least some participants at the Constitutional Convention and ratifying conventions anticipated delays or secrecy regarding certain information.  Further understanding can be gleaned from judicial interpretations of the clause in the context of intelligence budgets. A significant case is United States v. Richardson, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1974 (418 U.S. 166). In this case, a federal taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of provisions in the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, arguing that they violated the Statement and Account Clause. The contested provisions allowed the CIA to account for expenditures based solely on the Director's certificate (50 U.S.C. § 403j(b)).   Richardson had repeatedly sought detailed information about the CIA’s expenditures from government offices but found their responses unsatisfactory. He challenged the provision’s constitutionality, requesting the Treasury Department seek an opinion from the Attorney General. When this request was declined, Richardson filed suit. The district court dismissed his case for lack of standing and because the subject matter was considered a political question not suitable for judicial determination. His request for a three-judge court was also denied.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the dismissal and remanded it to a three-judge court. Ultimately, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the lower courts. The central issue before the Court was whether Richardson had standing to sue. Without addressing the constitutional question, the Court ruled that he did not have standing. In its ruling, the Court noted that if Richardson could not litigate this issue, no one else might be able to do so.
In a real sense, the absence of any specific individual or class to bring these claims supports the argument that the subject matter is committed to Congressional surveillance and ultimately to the political process. In footnote 11, the Court observed: Although we need not definitively address what constitutes "a regular Statement and Account," it is clear that Congress has broad authority to demand any reporting and accounting it deems appropriate in the public interest. This raises significant questions about whether the Constitution’s framers ever envisioned that general directives to the Congress or Executive could be enforced by an individual citizen. While the available evidence is neither conclusive in quality nor quantity, historical analysis of clause 7's origins suggests it was intended to permit some degree of secrecy in governmental operations. The ultimate enforcement power available to Congress would likely be the "power of the purse." Independent of the statute challenged here, Congress could grant standing to taxpayers or citizens, limited by Article III’s "cases" and "controversies" provision.  Nearly two centuries of acceptance support a reading of clause 7 as granting Congress plenary power to specify when and with what specificity Executive agencies must report expenditures of appropriated funds, and to exempt certain secret activities from comprehensive public reporting. See, for example, Farrand's Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 618-619 (1911); Elliot's Debates on the Federal Constitution 462 (1836); Miller's Secret Statutes of the United States 10 (1918).  Several lower court decisions also provide instructive context. In Harrington v. Bush, 553 F.2d 190 (D.C. Cir. 1977), a Member of Congress sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the CIA from using funding and reporting provisions under the 1949 Central Intelligence Act in connection with allegedly illegal activities. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit due to lack of standing, as the plaintiff did not contest the constitutional sufficiency of these provisions. In outlining the statutory and constitutional framework, the court noted that the funding and reporting requirements of the CIA Act represent an exception to general federal funding methods. Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution is not self-defining, giving Congress broad authority to interpret it.
The Congressionally chosen method for implementing Article I, Section 9, Clause 7's requirements is found in various statutory provisions. Key among these is 31 U.S.C. § 1029, which mandates that the Secretary of the Treasury provide an accurate and combined statement of public receipts and expenditures to Congress annually. Given Congress’s plenary power over defining the appropriations process and reporting requirements, it can establish exceptions to this general framework. An example is the CIA, for which specific exceptions were made.  In Halperin v. CIA (629 F.2d 144, D.C. Cir., 1980), a private citizen sought access to CIA documents concerning legal bills and fee arrangements under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The court held that these documents were exempt from disclosure under FOIA’s third exception, which covers information specifically exempted by statute. Judge Gasch determined that the exemption applied due to both the protection afforded intelligence sources and methods (50 U.S.C. § 403(d)(3) [1976]) and specific exemptions in Section 6 of the Central Intelligence Act (50 U.S.C. § 403g [1976]). The plaintiff argued that these statutes violated the Statement and Account Clause, but the appellate court rejected this claim, finding the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of secret CIA appropriations.  In its analysis of the constitutionality and justiciability of statutory secrecy for CIA expenditures, the Halperin court reviewed the historical context of the Statement and Account Clause. Notably, regarding debates in the Virginia ratifying convention in June 1788, the court observed that Mason’s statement revealed that Madison's comments on maintaining some expenditure secrets were not isolated but reflective of his fellow proponents of the "from time to time" provision. Additionally, the debates highlighted the potential need for secrecy in military operations and foreign negotiations, areas closely related to the CIA’s current responsibilities.
Finally, we discover that those opposing the "from time to time" provision, including Mason, advocated for secrecy primarily during operations and negotiations, but not for public records related to expenditures. However, the Statement and Account Clause, as ultimately adopted, aligns with the opponents' view, which sought discretion in keeping both expenditures and associated operations secret.  The court interpreted Patrick Henry's concerns about the "from time to time" language as evidence that the clause was intended to allow Congress and the President discretion to maintain secrecy regarding military operations and foreign negotiations. The court noted that Mason’s opponents clearly articulated this intention during the debates.  Moreover, the Halperin court found additional support for its interpretation of the Statement and Account Clause from historical practices before and after the Constitution. For instance, the Continental Congress established the Committee of Secret Correspondence on November 29, 1775, to handle expenses related to sending agents abroad. When the committee received crucial information from one of its agents, Arthur Lee, it decided to keep this communication strictly confidential, even from Congress.  Further evidence is provided by early practices under George Washington, where intelligence funds were often camouflaged regarding their recipients and intended use. A January 21, 1783 letter from Robert Morris, a member of the Committee of Secret Correspondence, illustrates both the anticipation of potential expenses for contingencies and secret service operations.
Drafts from that account seem to have been issued in favor of family members of Washington due to secret service needs, potentially concealing the true recipients' identities. The court also highlighted statutes establishing contingent funds or secret service funds, which provided the President a means for covert funding of foreign intelligence activities. For instance, the Act of July 1, 1790 (1 Stat. 128) created such a fund to support "persons serving the United States in foreign parts." The President was required to provide regular statements and accounts but could omit specific details deemed necessary. By February 9, 1793 (1 Stat. 299, 300), Congress amended this act to allow for secret expenditures without specifying by requiring a certificate from the President or Secretary of State.  In Aftergood v. Central Intelligence Agency (355 F. Supp. 2d 557, D.D.C. 2005), the plaintiff sought historical intelligence budget information from 1947 to 1970 and subsidiary agency budgets under FOIA from the CIA. The CIA refused disclosure by asserting exemption 3 (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)) based on 50 U.S.C. § 403-3(c)(7), which protects intelligence sources and methods. Both parties sought summary judgment, but the court granted the CIA's motion and denied the plaintiff Aftergood's. Aftergood argued that the Statement and Account Clause required publication of requested information. However, Judge Urbina dismissed this claim based on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's "unequivocal[]" ruling in Halperin (which cited Richardson), holding that FOIA plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge CIA budget secrecy under this clause.  The Statement and Account Clause appears to obligate Congress to periodically provide a statement and account of public funds' disposition. Debates at the Constitutional Convention and ratifying conventions primarily focused on timing and scope, rather than the obligation itself.
The debates at the Constitutional Convention and the ratification discussions suggest that delegates anticipated the need for some secrecy in military and foreign affairs, implying that the clause's language could allow Congress to determine which expenditures should remain confidential. Historically, both before and after the Constitution’s adoption, statutes or practices have kept certain intelligence information or activities closely held, as well as the nature and recipients of funds allocated for such activities. Early laws creating funds for contingent expenses or secret services typically included aggregate figures but allowed discretion in documenting specific expenditures from these funds.  Judicial interpretations suggest that Congress holds the power to define the scope of the clause’s language. Courts have consistently rejected challenges under the Statement and Account Clause, specifically regarding the CIA Act of 1949, which restricts access to information not disclosed due to the act's strictures. The Richardson Court and its successors have confirmed Congress’s authority to implement the clause by statute, requiring reporting as deemed public interest.  Congress has frequently, through statutory mandates, created funds for foreign intelligence activities, permitting expenditures via certificates without detailed reporting. The 1949 Act permits transferring funds from other agencies for intelligence purposes, enhancing the concealment of actual funding levels. It appears that the Constitution’s framers had some uncertainty about the extent of Congress's obligations under this clause.
Based on our review of constitutional language, historical context, and limited judicial interpretation, it appears that courts generally view Congress as having the authority to define the meaning of this clause. While courts have not had significant opportunities to address the issue on its merits, they might refrain from doing so if presented with a political question. To date, judicial interpretations suggest that a court is unlikely to compel the disclosure of the aggregate intelligence budget as constitutionally required.  The end of the Cold War significantly impacted intelligence budgets. With no longer an ongoing threat from a superpower with hostile intelligence services, substantial reductions in intelligence spending were implemented. Critics argued for greater transparency, prompting Senator Robert Kerrey's statement in November 1993: "Openness is the order of the day, and unless a threat as formidable and lethal as the old Soviet Union re-emerges, our society and government will continue to become more open. Our task is to make intelligence more useful to more Americans, not to hoard it."  Some also argued that past intelligence failures, such as misjudging the vulnerability of the Soviet system or underestimating Iraqi nuclear capabilities, justified a significant overhaul and downsizing of collection and analytical efforts.  Across-the-board reductions in defense spending affected intelligence funding in two ways. First, it was assumed that smaller military force structures reduced the need for an extensive intelligence infrastructure; fewer forces likely required fewer support personnel. However, some countered this view by arguing that leaner military structures might actually necessitate stronger intelligence support to ensure efficient use.  Secondly, as most of the intelligence budget remained "hidden" within the Defense Department (DOD) budget, reductions in overall defense spending necessitated either proportional cuts in intelligence programs or disproportionate reductions in non-intelligence programs to maintain existing intelligence spending levels. The latter option faced strong resistance from those already struggling to preserve other high-priority programs.  In summary, as defense spending contracted, maintaining and launching new intelligence initiatives became increasingly challenging. This debate over future intelligence requirements is closely linked to the ongoing controversy regarding the public disclosure of intelligence spending levels, with some opposing higher or existing intelligence budgets fearing that transparency could lead to drastic cuts in funding.
Efforts to reduce funding levels in intelligence authorization bills are complicated by concerns about shared oversight. In 1991, there was apprehension that reductions in FY1992 intelligence programs might be redirected to other defense programs rather than reducing the deficit. With the end of the Cold War, debates and floor votes in Congress revisited the issue of publicly disclosing the intelligence budget for the first time since 1975.  In considering the FY1992 intelligence authorization bill, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) proposed a bill (S. 1539) that would have mandated the disclosure of three versions of the total intelligence and intelligence-related budget figure: the amount requested by the President; the amount authorized to be appropriated by the conference committee; and the amount actually obligated by the executive branch. The SSCI decided against publishing the appropriation figure, as it was uncertain that such a tally could be completed before the conference committee issued its report due to the numerous line-items involved.  The Senate Armed Services Committee, which received the bill sequentially, noted these requirements represented significant departures from past practices and had "profound implications for U.S. intelligence activities and policy formulation." The committee proposed delaying the effective date of these provisions until FY1993 to allow detailed consideration. In contrast, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) version of the bill (H.R. 2038) did not include any provision for public disclosure.  The conference committee agreed with the Senate's objective but chose not to mandate disclosure by law. Instead, it expressed hope that "the [Intelligence] Committees, working with the President, will make such information available to the American people in a manner that does not jeopardize national security interests" in 1993.  The final legislation (P.L. 102-183) stated: It is the sense of Congress that beginning in 1993 and each year thereafter, the total amount requested, authorized for, and spent on intelligence and related activities should be disclosed to the public in an appropriate manner. The opposition from the George H.W. Bush Administration may have played a significant role in the rejection of mandatory disclosures.
Bush, a former DCI who had previously advocated against public disclosure in 1977, stated upon signing the final version of the legislation: "Because secrecy is indispensable for intelligence activities to succeed, the funding levels authorized by this Act are classified and should remain so." Despite Robert Gates' statement at his confirmation hearing in September 1991 that he did not have a problem with releasing the top line number of the Intelligence Community budget but acknowledged it was controversial, the Administration maintained its position. The following year, both Intelligence Committees focused on reorganizing the Intelligence Community and held extensive hearings on the issue. The Senate version of the FY1993 intelligence authorization bill (S. 2991) included a "sense of Congress" provision similar to that in the FY1992 legislation. Although the House version (H.R. 5095) did not contain such a provision, the conference committee adopted the Senate's provision as Section 303 in the final bill. Conferees reaffirmed their hope that the intelligence committees would work with the President to make available to the American people, without jeopardizing national security interests, the total funding for intelligence and related activities. President Bush signed the legislation (P.L. 102-496) on October 24, 1992, without comment.  With the start of the Clinton Administration in January 1993, some believed the question might be revisited with a different outcome. Senator Howard Metzenbaum wrote to President Clinton on February 24, 1993, urging public disclosure of the intelligence budget. Woolsey, the newly appointed DCI, testified before the HPSCI on March 9, 1993, expressing concerns about disclosing intelligence spending levels publicly: "There is no electronic or data fence around the United States or American citizens. Disclosing these numbers and ensuing debates means revealing them to our targets overseas." His skepticism stemmed from the need for a detailed public debate before any changes could be proposed.
In such debates, it is inconceivable that we would withhold information and details as the public and Congress publicly discussed these issues without recognizing potential damage. Clinton himself responded to Metzenbaum on March 27, requesting the opportunity to "evaluate both the benefits and legitimate concerns associated with such public disclosure." The House version of the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization bill (H.R. 2330) did not include any provision for public disclosure, but for the first time in three years, the Senate version (S. 1301) also lacked this provision. Senator Arlen Specter stated that such a provision was omitted "on the expectation that there would be a stronger resolution compelling disclosure."  On August 4, 1993, the House debated an amendment offered by Representative Barney Frank mandating the disclosure of "the aggregate amounts requested and authorized for, and spent on, intelligence and intelligence-related activities" beginning in 1995 under H.R. 2330. The amendment failed with a vote of 169-264. Many who supported this amendment also backed other budget-reduction measures, with observers hoping or fearing that public disclosure would lead to demands for spending cuts. However, not all agreed with this view.  In the Senate, on October 18, 1993, Senator Daniel P. Moynihan introduced an amendment to the FY1994 Defense Appropriation bill (H.R. 3116) requiring "a separate, unclassified statement of the aggregate amount of budget outlays for the prior fiscal year for national and tactical intelligence activities." Although this figure would include expenditures for collecting, analyzing, producing, disseminating or supporting the collection of intelligence under the Department of Defense budget. Senator Moynihan, a critic of the Intelligence Community who had previously introduced legislation to transfer CIA functions to the State Department (S. 1682), withdrew the amendment shortly after introducing it. However, it drew support from then-Chairman of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense, Senator Daniel Inouye.  Three weeks later, on November 10, 1993, the Senate debated an amendment to the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization bill offered by Senator Metzenbaum, essentially including the same "sense of Congress" language as in two previously enacted intelligence authorization bills. Although this provision had not been controversial in the Senate before, incoming Republican vice chairman of the SSCI, Senator John Warner, spoke against it in 1993.
The members stated that while the details of intelligence spending could remain confidential, the overall level must be open to public scrutiny. They argued that the norms of a democratic system require such transparency. In response, the President, in a December 27, 1993 letter to Representative Glickman, expressed opposition to the proposal in 1993 on the grounds that he believed the costs of disclosure outweighed its benefits. However, he requested Anthony Lake, the National Security Adviser, along with the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and others, to carefully review their stance in light of the arguments made by Glickman and to consult with Congress.  By January 1994, both the executive and legislative branches were committed to reviewing the advisability of making intelligence spending levels public. Congressional hearings were scheduled for that year, and an NSC-level review was already underway. At the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) hearings held on February 22-23, 1994, DCI Woolsey reiterated his opposition to budgetary disclosure. He stressed the challenges of conducting a public debate on intelligence programs and priorities, and expressed concerns that revealing even aggregate numbers could inform adversaries such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, and terrorist groups about U.S. plans and operations.  The 1994-1995 debate occurred against the backdrop of declining budgets and an evolving intelligence landscape. The oft-cited phrase used by DCI Woolsey during his confirmation hearings—a world where "the Soviet dragon has been slain, but jungles still contain a bewildering variety of poisonous snakes"—reflected this changing environment. Despite these challenges, on July 19, 1994, the House voted 194-221-24 to reject an amendment proposed by Representative Glickman, Chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which aimed to amend the National Security Act of 1947 to require annual reports of intelligence and related activities funding. The Senate version did not address this question.  A similar pattern emerged in subsequent years. On September 13, 1995, the House again voted (in the Committee of the Whole) 154-271-9 against an amendment proposed by Representative Frank to disclose aggregate intelligence and related activities funding. The Senate bill did not include any provisions on this issue. However, in 1996, the Senate passed its version of the FY1997 intelligence authorization bill (S. 1718), which included a provision requiring the President to submit with the annual budget submission the aggregate amount appropriated for the current year and the amount requested for the next year for intelligence and related activities.
On May 22, 1996, the House voted in the Committee of the Whole (176-248-9) to reject an amendment proposed by Representative Conyers that would have required the President to submit a separate unclassified statement on national and tactical intelligence activities' appropriations and proposed appropriations. The subsequent Conference Committee followed suit, dropping this provision. On July 9, 1997, the House again rejected a similar amendment (192-237-5) offered by Representatives Conyers in the Committee of the Whole, which would have mandated the same disclosure for the FY1998 intelligence authorization bill. The Senate also voted against a related amendment proposed by Senator Torricelli on June 19, 1997 (43-56-1), rejecting a requirement to disclose annual figures for intelligence and intelligence-related activities.  Despite these votes, interest in publicizing intelligence spending levels remained high. In 1996, the Aspin-Brown Commission, established under the FY1995 Intelligence Authorization Act, recommended that at the start of each congressional budget cycle, the President or a designee disclose the total amount appropriated for intelligence activities and the next fiscal year's requested amount. These disclosures could be included in the President’s annual budget submission or sent separately to the congressional intelligence committees as unclassified letters. The Commission also stipulated that no further disclosures should be made.  In response, on April 23, 1996, President Clinton authorized Congress to make public the total appropriation for intelligence at the time of approval of the appropriations conference report. However, this authorization was not implemented by the Legislative Branch. In October 1997, DCI Tenet announced that President Clinton had granted him permission to release the aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence and intelligence-related activities for FY1997 ($26.6 billion). The decision was based on two key points: first, ensuring no harm could be caused by revealing future trends; second, maintaining the confidentiality of specific budget details related to individual intelligence agencies or programs.
In summary, the Administration plans to establish a clear boundary at this top-line, aggregate budget figure, refraining from disclosing any additional classified information that could jeopardize national security. The press release acknowledged an earlier lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act and noted the President's preference for coordinated action with Congress on intelligence budget declassification; however, current legal circumstances precluded joint proceedings. In March 1998, Tenet announced that the total amount appropriated for intelligence and related activities for fiscal year 1998 was $26.7 billion, asserting that this release would not compromise national security or intelligence sources and methods. This was the last such disclosure; following legal challenges seeking more detailed budget information, Tenet did not publicize the FY1999 appropriation amount. Some speculate that Tenet's reluctance to disclose further funds might have been influenced by the apparent inclusion of significant supplemental funding in the October 1998 Supplemental Appropriation Act (P.L. 105-277). No subsequent releases were made.  The September 11, 2001 attacks significantly altered the priorities regarding intelligence spending. The focus shifted from reducing budgets to enhancing capabilities for counterterrorism and understanding the failure in early warning systems. Numerous investigations were initiated to address these issues, leading to a notable inclination within both the Executive Branch and Congress to substantially increase intelligence funding.  Legislative efforts followed with the recommendation that total national intelligence appropriations be made public. This marked a shift from the Clinton Administration's practice of FY1997 and 1998, where the aggregate amount was released publicly. Senate legislation in response to these recommendations aimed at making such information transparent.  Ultimately, the DNI position was created to oversee budget development and execution for national intelligence operations, aligning with broader efforts to enhance transparency and efficiency in intelligence activities.
The National Intelligence Program (NIP) was considered for renaming in 2845, with the condition that the President disclose annually the aggregate amount requested for the NIP, while Congress would make public the authorized and appropriated amounts. Although a similar provision was absent from the House bill dealing with intelligence reorganization (H.R. 10), an amendment to exclude this requirement in the Senate bill was tabled on October 4, 2004, by a vote of 55 to 37. Ultimately, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) did not include the Senate’s provision for public disclosure of intelligence spending.  In 2006, the Senate Intelligence Committee reintroduced this issue through S. 3237. Section 107 of the bill mandated that the President disclose annually to the public the aggregate amount requested for the NIP. It also required Congress to make public the authorized and appropriated amounts each year, likely including any funds from supplemental appropriations bills. Additionally, it mandated a DNI study on whether such information should be made public for each element of the Intelligence Community.  This provision was not included in the House version of the FY2007 intelligence authorization bill (H.R. 5020). An identical provision appeared in S. 372, reported by the Senate in January 2007. When considering this provision in S. 3237, Congress may weigh various factors, including whether public disclosure of intelligence budgets aligns with constitutional principles and democratic interests. Some argue that current enemies could no longer exploit knowledge of overall intelligence spending since Cold War conditions have changed. However, others, particularly in the House, fear that declassifying such information could compromise critical source and method details.  Congress may also consider the potential need for a separate intelligence appropriations bill, which could impede the flexible allocation between intelligence and non-intelligence defense programs, potentially harming the overall intelligence effort.
Secondly, actions taken in national intelligence efforts through supplemental appropriations bills must be justified more publicly than might be ideal in certain circumstances. Additionally, disclosing National Intelligence Program (NIP) details without those of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) could give a misleading impression of the intelligence effort’s scope. Most experts contend that intelligence and related activities are operationally intertwined, making it essential to consider them together for a comprehensive understanding of capabilities. This distinction impacts both those seeking across-the-board reductions in intelligence spending and those arguing for increased funding due to growing threats.  If intelligence-related activities were included, as occurred with the FY1997 and 1998 budget disclosures by DCI Tenet, recognizing the nuanced boundaries between these activities and other targeting efforts would be crucial. There is potential for "budget games" to misrepresent commitment levels to intelligence by shifting individual programs between categories.  After decades of debate, the core issues surrounding public disclosure of the intelligence budget remain unresolved. Questions persist regarding whether constitutional requirements mandate such transparency and if limited data can be released without compromising classified information or aiding adversaries. Beyond these concerns, the challenge lies in framing a meaningful public discussion on intelligence spending. Providing an overview of how the U.S. Intelligence Community functions without revealing extensive details that could be misused is complex.  Funding for intelligence-related activities presents unique challenges due to annual fluctuations based on program transfers between accounts. Publicly disclosing only national intelligence figures simplifies matters but fails to accurately reflect the broader scope of the intelligence effort. Philosophical and political disagreements will continue regarding how much, if any, information about the intelligence budget should be made public.
The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted in early 1931 and underwent amendments during the mid-1930s before becoming an integral part of federal contract practices. In the mid-1950s, it gained greater prominence with the addition of the "prevailing wage principle" to various federal statutes. For over four decades, and continuing into the 21st century, the Davis-Bacon Act has been a focal point of public policy discussions, influencing legislation, administrative rulemaking, and court litigation.  The 1931 Davis-Bacon Act mandates that construction contracts between the federal government and contractors specify minimum wages for different classes of laborers. These minimum wages are defined as those prevailing in the locality of the project for similar crafts and skills on comparable work. In 1964, the concept of wages was expanded to include fringe benefits, and the act has a coverage threshold of $2,000.  The Davis-Bacon Act's "prevailing wage principle" has been incorporated into more than 50 federal program statutes beyond direct federal construction contracts. It is supported by the 1934 Copeland "anti-kickback" Act, which mandates weekly reporting of wages and ensures that any deductions are legitimate. Additionally, federal overtime pay and health and safety standards statutes supplement the act.  Many states have also enacted their own "little Davis-Bacon" acts to further enforce labor standards within their jurisdictions.  The debate over the act continues, with arguments both for and against its implementation. Proponents argue that it protects workers, stabilizes the construction industry, and serves federal contractors effectively. Critics contend that it is anti-competitive, hindering flexible workforce utilization. Questions remain regarding the statute's administration, effectiveness, and potential for equitable enforcement.  This report examines policy issues arising from the Davis-Bacon Act over the years and continuing into the 21st century. These include procedures for determining wage rates, reporting requirements under the Copeland Act, an appropriate threshold for activating the statute, interagency relationships in enforcing and ensuring compliance with the act, administrative or judicial appeals procedures, the use of "helpers" and other low-skilled workers on covered projects, and a President's authority to suspend the statute, including conditions for such suspension.
The foundational premise of the Davis-Bacon Act remains a subject of debate even after 75 years. Historically, it has enjoyed strong bipartisan support; however, since the mid-1950s, it has faced increasingly militant criticism. Federal agencies have publicly disagreed on its usefulness and administration. The act has undergone judicial review, with each new application subjecting it to further examination.  Although the Department of Labor (DOL) has made certain administrative changes, the statute itself has remained largely unchanged since 1935. Over the years, Congress has extended the act's provisions to cover an ever-wider segment of federal and federally assisted construction, providing opportunities for renewed debate on its relevance and impact.  Critics argue that while justified in 1931, the act is now obsolete due to market changes and the enactment of other labor standards laws, particularly the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. They contend it is inflationary, increasing construction costs and potentially reducing job opportunities. Additionally, they assert it is anti-competitive, discriminates against smaller firms, and is administratively burdensome. They believe repeal or significant modification would reduce paperwork burden and enhance contractor flexibility.  Supporters maintain that the Davis-Bacon Act remains crucial today as it prevents competition from "fly-by-night" firms that undercut local wages and conditions, ensuring fairer competition with local contractors for federal work. They argue it stabilizes the industry, benefiting both workers and employers. Additionally, they claim it may reduce initial construction costs through greater efficiency and decrease repair needs. The act also discourages fragmentation of work and the use of low-skill crews, promoting formal apprenticeship programs.  The literature on Davis-Bacon is extensive and varied, typically falling into three categories: public materials such as legislative hearings and agency reports; journalistic pieces; and academic studies, some commissioned by interest groups but still considered scholarly.
In some cases, scholarship has merged with journalism. Since the initial consideration of prevailing wage legislation at the federal level, numerous congressional hearings have examined the statute. However, these often focused on broader policy concerns rather than specific economic impacts.  As the Davis-Bacon debate evolved, arguments progressed through various levels of affirmation and rebuttal, most of which remain subject to repeated counterarguments. Despite this, significant gaps in our knowledge about the act, its administration, and impact persist. Few public or private studies of the statute have escaped criticism for methodological flaws or insufficient sample sizes.  Prevailing wage protection on public contracts began at the state level before being adopted by the federal government. Congressional interest in federal prevailing wage legislation predates both the "New Deal" and the 1929 economic collapse, emerging during a period of relative prosperity in the construction industry. As William Tracy, from the Building Trades Department, AFL, noted, “the building industry was enjoying its greatest prosperity with wages, hours, and working conditions better than ever before.”  However, this period also saw turbulence and intense competition within the contracting community. In February 1927, during hearings before the House Committee on Labor, Representative Robert L. Bacon (R-N.Y.) echoed Tracy's views. He observed that in New York, "wages are fair, and there has been no difficulty between employees and employers for some time." Bacon aimed to maintain this status quo by introducing legislation in 1927 that required locally prevailing wage standards for federal construction work.  Problems arose with the construction of a federal hospital in Bacon's district. Local contractors submitted bids reflecting local standards, but the contract was awarded to an Alabama firm. Bacon noted that "they brought some thousand non-union laborers from Alabama into Long Island, N.Y.; they were herded onto this job, housed in shacks, paid very low wages, and the work proceeded." In Bacon's view, when government contracts were issued, it should comply with local wage standards to respect existing local norms without artificially inflating wages. His measure was not adopted.  A similar bill was introduced in 1928, garnering strong support from the U.S. Congress.
In a note to Labor Secretary James J. Davis, Commissioner of Labor Statistics Ethelbert Stewart questioned: "Is the government willing to compromise all labor standards in favor of the lowest bidder by utilizing the cheapest available interstate labor?" Stewart and Davis both expressed strong support for the Bacon bill. Hearings up to this point had generally favored the prevailing wage concept, though specific proposals garnered mixed reactions. However, the legislation failed when Congress adjourned.  After nearly a decade as Secretary of Labor under Presidents Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover (1921-1930), James J. Davis transitioned to become a United States Senator. As his first act in office, he introduced prevailing wage legislation, with Representative Bacon offering a corresponding bill.  The Davis-Bacon proposals were crafted by a committee representing all departments of the Hoover Administration and unanimously agreed upon. William N. Doak, who succeeded Davis as Labor Secretary, testified in favor of these measures, emphasizing that existing contracting practices were "disturbing to both labor and business." During Senate deliberations, Senator Robert LaFollette (Progressive Republican-Wisconsin), chairman of the Committee on Manufactures, urged swift enactment.  The Senate report, authored by Senator Davis, affirmed that the legislation did not establish new wage scales but merely required contractors to pay prevailing local wages. This was described as "fair and just" for employees, contractors, and the government alike. A similar report from Representative Richard J. Welch (R-Calif.) for the House Committee on Labor echoed these sentiments.  Despite unanimous support in reports, reservations were expressed in the House. Representative Thomas L. Blanton (D-Texas) criticized it as "the most ridiculous proposition I have ever seen," arguing that workers and contractors should be free to negotiate wages without a mandated minimum.
Representative Blanton observed, "You are stripping American citizens, contractors, and laborers alike of their fundamental right to contract—their ability to make agreements for themselves," noting that this bill interferes with a sacred, inalienable right essential for personal initiative and independence. In the Record, Blanton included a letter from Comptroller General J. R. McCarl, who highlighted concerns regarding wage rate determinations made after bids had been submitted. McCarl argued that parties to the agreement could not predict the prevailing rates during contract formation. A. P. Greensfelder, President of the Associated General Contractors of America, concurred with McCarl's judgment, emphasizing the uncertainty this would create, while still supporting the principle that contractors should pay no less than locally prevailing wages.  Representative Anning Prall (D-N.Y.) also voiced concerns about the bill's enforcement mechanisms. Although he supported the legislation, he believed it needed stronger provisions to combat potential law-breaking by unscrupulous contractors. Eventually, the act was adopted without a roll call and signed into law on March 3, 1931, by President Hoover.  Dissatisfaction with the Davis-Bacon Act soon emerged among both labor and contractors. The initial enactment was simplistic and brief, lacking effective mechanisms for enforcement or policing of its requirements. Armand Thieblot suggests that it failed to inform workers about their protections under the new statute. Trade unionists worried that the act's scope might inadvertently leave many workers unprotected, particularly in contracts below the $5,000 threshold, which could be fragmented to avoid compliance—a significant concern for painting and decorating crafts. The AFL's Executive Council noted that while the act would benefit some workers, more amendments were necessary to protect building trades.  Industry opposition centered on the determination of wage rates being made after bids had been submitted, a critical issue.
Thieblot, who initially shared McCarl's concerns as Comptroller General, noted: "Postdetermination of wages meant that contractors could be compelled to pay higher wages than those originally included in their bids based on Labor Secretary's determinations." As a result, contractors were essentially bidding blindly, agreeing to pay whatever wage the Secretary determined to be prevailing in the locality. At the outset, the term "prevailing" and certain other phrases used in the act were not entirely clear.  Soon after, changes to the act were proposed. In January 1932, the House Committee on Labor initiated oversight hearings. However, President Hoover responded promptly with Executive Order No. 5778, dated January 19, 1932, which was made public two days later. Behind-the-scenes negotiations over amending the act seemed intense. Initially, organized labor pushed Congress to strengthen penalties in the statute. Oversight hearings began early in January 1932 but were immediately followed by President Hoover's issuance of Executive Order No. 5778.  Representative William Connery (D-Mass.), recalling events not immediately challenged, stated that "after a meeting with Secretary Doak, representatives from the building trades struck a deal: if the President issued an executive order on the Davis-Bacon bill, they would oppose further legislation on the matter by the Committee on Labor."  President Hoover's Executive Order mandated that all Davis-Bacon contracts include the following stipulations: - Wages must be paid in full at least once a week "in lawful money of the United States" without subsequent deductions. - Workers are to be regarded as employed by the contractor or subcontractor, regardless of any other contractual relationships. - Payroll records must be available for inspection by the contracting officer but not interfere with work progress. - Contract rates must be prominently displayed at the work site.
Should it be determined that a contractor or subcontractor has paid their workers less than the stipulated prevailing rate of wages, the government may terminate the contract and take over the work to complete it, either by direct action or through another method. The contractor and their sureties would then be liable for any additional costs incurred by the government as a result.  During congressional oversight hearings on the act, Executive Order No. 5778 appeared to prompt various parties to pause and regroup. Given that the order was unilaterally issued by the President and could be modified or revoked at subsequent presidential discretion, this caused some concern and likely contributed to efforts for statutory codification.  The views regarding the executive order were mixed. Labor, which had feared that any review of the statute might jeopardize "whatever benefits we have secured through current legislation," generally approved of the Hoover initiative. Representative Bacon stated that the order simply implemented in government contracts what Congress intended with the law. Secretary Doak noted that the act had worked out more satisfactorily than expected and believed the order would be helpful in stabilizing wage rates, predicting no need for further legislation at the time.  Industry, however, was less pleased, arguing that wage rates should be known before bidding. Senator Jesse Metcalf's (R-R.I.) bill aimed to achieve this by predetermining wages, allowing contract reopening for extended periods, implementing an "anti-kickback" provision, and setting enforcement procedures with penalties for violations. The measure was adopted in the Senate with minimal debate and a voice vote.  By June 1932, when the Metcalf bill came up in the House, opinion had solidified: Labor opposed it while industry supported its passage. The bill was significantly modified on the floor to make it more acceptable to labor but remained controversial.  During hearings and debates, issues that would continue to be contentious for the next six decades were raised. These included questions such as: What constitutes a prevailing wage? How is a prevailing wage determined and when? Should there be regional variations in standards? Would wages under Davis-Bacon be comparable for private and public construction? What defines an appropriate locality for wage determinations? And how should abuses under the act, notably kickbacks, be addressed?
On June 13, 1934, President Roosevelt signed the Copeland "anti-kickback" Act as a supplement to the Davis-Bacon Act. This legislation stipulates that anyone who induces a person engaged in federal or federally financed construction to relinquish any part of their compensation under their contract—by force, intimidation, threats, or other means—is subject to a fine not exceeding $5,000, imprisonment for no more than five years, or both penalties. The act authorized administrative agencies to "make reasonable regulations" for its enforcement but required that each contractor and subcontractor furnish weekly a sworn affidavit detailing wages paid to each employee during the preceding week.  During a comprehensive review of federal contracting policies, Senator David Walsh (D-Mass.) oversaw the Davis-Bacon Act's implementation. He concluded that the statute was "inadequate to address many of the practices contractors have employed." This finding was echoed by other departments involved with the act.  By spring 1935, Senator Walsh had proposed significant amendments. These included reducing the dollar volume threshold for coverage from $5,000 to $2,000, extending coverage to all federal contract construction projects involving public buildings or works, authorizing withholding of funds by contracting agencies to pay appropriate wages to underpaid workers, directing the Comptroller General to compile a list of contractors who had "disregarded their obligations," and providing laborers with the right to sue contractors for unpaid wages.
Davis-Bacon contracts stipulated minimum wages for various laborers and mechanics, predetermining these rates before contractors submitted bids. Although certain provisions may have been contentious, the Walsh amendments were passed unanimously in the Senate without debate and favorably reported in the House without changes. The Committee on Labor noted that the bill was a logical extension of Congress's four-year policy on minimum wages for public construction projects. In the House, the bill was quickly passed with no discussion. It was signed into law by the President just one week later.  For two decades following 1935, the Davis-Bacon Act became an integral part of federal contract policy, though its historical details remain largely unexplored. The act's core concept—that the United States, as a consumer, has the right to set standards in government contracts—meant that contractors had to meet specified labor standards if they wished to undertake federal construction work. In 1936, this principle was extended to include contract purchases of goods through the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. The McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act further expanded these protections in 1965.  In 1938, Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), establishing a general minimum wage and overtime structure for the private sector. This broader labor legislation may have reduced interest in the Davis-Bacon and Walsh-Healey Acts. Some later argued that the Davis-Bacon Act was no longer necessary with the FLSA's comprehensive protections.  In 1940, the Act’s provisions were extended to the territories of Hawaii and Alaska. In 1941, it applied to cost-plus/negotiated construction contracts. During World War II, federal contracting entered a new era. Early in the 1940s, government procurement agencies and international unions entered agreements that stabilized wages and conditions during critical wartime production stages. President Harry Truman later recalled the machinery established by these agreements as pivotal for ensuring labor stability amid rapid industrial expansion.
The breakdown of wage patterns in a specific area led to various observations regarding the Davis-Bacon Act during the 1950s Eisenhower Era. Despite differing opinions and significant opposition, Congress continued to uphold and extend Davis-Bacon coverage through provisions in federal program statutes.  From legislative activity reviewed, several key points emerge:  First, attaching Davis-Bacon provisions to program statutes appeared more contentious than the initial passage of the Davis-Bacon Act itself, sparking greater debate.  Second, as late as the mid-1950s, many Republican Congressmen still claimed credit for the statute. Representative Russell Mack (R-Wash.) noted that both Senators Davis and Bacon, Republicans from Pennsylvania and New York respectively, authored the law, which was passed by a Republican House and Senate and signed by President Herbert Hoover.  Third, some Members supported the act primarily to benefit contractors, as Representative Thor Tollefson (R-Wash.) recalled: "The Davis-Bacon Act has been valuable as a remedial measure to protect contractors and craftsmen from unfair contract bids," adding that it was necessary to eliminate bidding advantages for contractors paying low wages in union-rate areas. He asserted the act ensured "[e]quality of bidding opportunity" for all contractors, protecting them against unfair competition.  Fourth, debates over the cost impact of Davis-Bacon were divided. In a 1956 report on highway legislation, five Members dissented, citing potential increased costs ranging from $2 to $4 billion as a significant drawback. Representative Mack (R-Wash.) countered that the act merely "keep[s] wages ... " at levels deemed fair by the statute.
Mack asserted that the Davis-Bacon act does not increase wages but prevents wage cuts, which they sought to avoid. He noted that the Washington State Highway Commission supported this provision. Gardner Withrow (R-Wisc.) concurred, stating that the Davis-Bacon Act would not raise the cost of highway construction any more than it is currently. He further emphasized that responsible road professionals in Wisconsin confirmed that the current cost under the Davis-Bacon Act would remain unchanged.  A similar debate occurred in the Senate. The initial 1955 highway legislation did not address Davis-Bacon coverage. Labor unions advocated for specific prevailing wage provisions during hearings, which were included when the bill was reported. However, Senators Edward Martin (R-Pa.), Prescott Bush (R-Conn.), and Norris Cotton (R-N.H.) opposed this addition, arguing that it would expand federal bureaucracy, create paperwork and litigation, increase agency control, and pose definitional problems.  The provision was ultimately removed during floor debate but later reinstated by the House. After negotiation with the Senate, the Davis-Bacon requirement was included in the final bill (1956).  During the Eisenhower era, some Members found it perplexing that the act remained controversial. Representative Katharine St. George (R-N.Y.) questioned why there had been no objections to the provision for many years. Similarly, Representative Frank Smith (D-Miss.) noted that his committee had consistently voted on bills including Davis-Bacon provisions.  In the early 1960s, major federal construction programs in defense and space prompted a reassessment of labor standards requirements. A perception, though not necessarily justified, was that the federal construction program faced significant labor-management issues. These included delays due to jurisdictional disputes between unions and increased costs associated with strikes or walkouts on critical projects.
There were allegations of turf disputes involving both workers and contracting or supply firms, which affected the applicability of federal contract labor standards laws. Due to higher wage requirements under Davis-Bacon compared to those under Walsh-Healey, employers might prefer classifying work as "manufacturing" rather than construction to reduce labor costs. In defense and aerospace construction, work extended beyond mere bricklaying and masonry. For instance, installing technical electronic equipment raised questions: was it part of the manufacturing process covered by the Walsh-Healey Act or considered construction under Davis-Bacon? Prefabrication further complicated matters; a "batch plant" distant from a site could still be considered within Davis-Bacon's scope. These issues were not easily resolved.  Additionally, Congress adopted the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act in 1965, mandating different labor standards for service workers, creating ambiguity as to whether technical installations fell under construction, manufacturing, or services. Collective bargaining agreements also played a role; defining work by craft or skill could determine union jurisdiction. In 1962, Representative James Roosevelt (D-Calif.) chaired the Special Subcommittee on Labor, which conducted hearings on the Davis-Bacon Act for the first time in nearly three decades. The subcommittee toured defense and space installations to gain firsthand knowledge of the act's administration.  The hearings' agenda focused on three areas: how the Secretary of Labor determines prevailing wages and criteria used; whether a review process should be established for these determinations; and any proposals to improve or clarify the act. Despite efforts to maintain focus, a wide range of complaints and suggestions were heard over three years, setting a 30-year agenda for future Davis-Bacon hearings. When aggrieved by DOL decisions, interested parties had limited recourse beyond requesting reconsideration.
On January 3, 1964, Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz created administratively a Wage Appeals Board (WAB), which he noted would "directly report to the Secretary of Labor." The three-member board was appointed by the Secretary with one member designated as chairman. In his order, Wirtz affirmed that the Board would act as the authorized representative of the Secretary in deciding appeals concerning questions of fact and law taken at the discretion of the Board from wage determinations issued under the Davis-Bacon Act and its related minimum wage statutes. For questions of law, the WAB was to rely on advice from the Solicitor at the Department of Labor (DOL), who would also represent the Department in each proceeding.  Six months later, when Charles Donahue, then Labor Solicitor, testified before a Subcommittee on June 23, 1964, he assured members that DOL's review process was in place and functioning. Some viewed Wirtz's action as preemptive, given that legislation to create such a review procedure had been under active consideration by the Subcommittee for several years. Representative Roman Pucinski (D-Ill.) noted, "I think the Department saw the handwriting on the wall." Ultimately, when the 1964 Davis-Bacon amendments were enacted, Congress did not include language addressing a review procedure, maintaining the Secretary's arrangement.  Stability and fairness in the construction market had been primary concerns of the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. The act aimed to prevent contractors from bidding on public work based on low wages and poor working conditions that deviated from local standards. In 1964, Congress extended the definition of "prevailing wage" to include fringe benefits due to similar assumptions.  Supporters argued that contractors under a collective bargaining agreement typically provide unit members with fringe benefits such as health insurance and paid vacation time. Non-union firms might offer comparable benefits voluntarily but are not contractually obligated to do so. Critics contended that adding a fringe benefit component could increase the cost of public construction, citing variability in the value of fringe benefit packages across different firms and employment situations.
Finally, some argued that even if a fringe benefit component were justified, it should not be treated as a standalone issue but rather as part of broader Davis-Bacon reform efforts. When the Roosevelt Subcommittee introduced legislation to add a fringe benefit component to Davis-Bacon wage calculations in 1964, there was minimal controversy. The provision received support from the Johnson Administration and was passed by the House on January 28, 1964, with a vote of 357 yeas to 50 nays. It was subsequently approved by the Senate on June 23, 1964.  The original Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 included a provision that allowed the President to suspend the statute during a national emergency. However, the act's authors had left the concept of "national emergency" undefined, and it was unclear how long such a suspension could last. Before considering Nixon's 1971 suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act, it is worthwhile to briefly review Roosevelt's suspension in 1934.  On June 5, 1934, President Roosevelt suspended the Davis-Bacon Act as an administrative convenience to allow for smoother operation of various New Deal statutes. He did not define "national emergency," merely noting that concurrent operation of the Davis-Bacon Act and the National Industrial Recovery Act caused "administrative confusion and delay." Three weeks later, on June 30, 1934, Roosevelt issued another proclamation, stating that revoking the June 5 proclamation would be in the public interest and reinstating the Davis-Bacon Act. No further public explanation for his actions was provided.  In 1970 and 1971, President Richard Nixon showed significant interest in addressing wage-price issues in the construction industry due to inflationary concerns. On January 18, 1971, he met with the Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Commission and urged them to address the wage-price spiral. Discussions included suggestions for suspending Davis-Bacon.  Despite negotiations involving key figures such as AFL-CIO President George Meany, OMB Director George Shultz, Secretary of Labor James Hodgson, and labor economist John Dunlop, no concrete solution was reached. On February 23, 1971, Nixon suspended the Davis-Bacon Act.
He noted that the nation faces a critical situation in the construction industry due to conditions involving excessive collective bargaining settlements, frequent and prolonged work stoppages, and wage/price spirals, all of which are impacting the general economy. Consequently, he suspended the act, including any Executive Orders, proclamations, rules, regulations, or directives that depend on determinations by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act.  President Nixon acknowledged that his action was targeted at organized labor but also stated that "wage rates on federal projects have been artificially set by this law rather than by market forces." He believed that this preferential arrangement is not in the best interests of either the construction industry or the American public during times of severe wage inflation. Additionally, he rescinded the Davis-Bacon provisions included in over 50 program statutes and urged states and other governmental bodies with similar laws to take comparable action.  The suspension seemed more aimed at encouraging labor and management, particularly labor, to adopt a responsible wage/price policy rather than an outright attack on the act. Nixon observed that decisive government action was necessary to protect public interest while labor and management worked to address the underlying issues.  In response, many questions emerged: Were inflationary wage settlements in construction what Congress had intended when it included the "national emergency" provision? Did the President have authority under this provision to rescind not only Davis-Bacon but also prevailing wage provisions from decades of federal program statutes? And could the President preempt state "little Davis-Bacon Acts"?  Hodgson noted that the suspension might help achieve more reasonable industry-wide settlements and restore a better balance in bargaining. Although he did not define these terms, his goal was clear: moderate union demands for less costly wage agreements to maintain balance, potentially leading to the reinstatement of Davis-Bacon.  Unions criticized Nixon's suspension, with Meany calling it "punitive against workers" and an invitation for employers to exploit them. Analyst John Herling commented that the suspension had brought cheer to some in the U.S.
The Chamber of Commerce has long fought to remove the Davis-Bacon Act from the Statute Books. Some state prevailing wage laws predated the federal statute's enactment. How would suspending the Davis-Bacon Act affect state practices? Peter G. Nash, then-U.S. Solicitor of Labor, stated that "the weight of authority supports the conclusion that states are now preempted (effectively a 'negative' preemption) from applying their prevailing wage standards to federally-assisted construction work subject to DBRA [Davis-Bacon and Related Acts] wage protections prior to February 23, 1971." However, not everyone concurred. For instance, New York's Commissioner of Labor, Louis Levine, maintained that wages on public construction projects would continue to be based on the state prevailing wage rate law.  In response to the Administration’s urging, labor and management in the construction industry continued to meet under Dunlop's guidance. On March 29, 1971, just over a month after the suspension, President Nixon issued Executive Order 11588, declaring that the suspension was no longer necessary "due to the establishment of an equitable stabilization plan." This order created the Construction Industry Stabilization Committee (a tripartite body appointed by the Secretary of Labor and directed by John Dunlop) as part of a broader regulatory wage/price apparatus for the construction industry. Consequently, he reinstated the Davis-Bacon Act along with its related regulations.  The Davis-Bacon Act had been continuously under scrutiny since the mid-1950s. During and shortly after the Carter Administration, it gained increased attention due to vigorous pro and con arguments. This period of tension originated from the original debates over prevailing wage legislation. The bills that became the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act were partly crafted in response to rulings by then Comptroller General J.R. McCarl of the General Accounting Office (GAO), who stated that the federal government, when contracting for construction work, was compelled to accept the lowest responsible bid. During this period, "responsibility" generally referred to fiduciary matters and the bidder's ability to complete the contracted work. Wages and working conditions were not considered relevant factors. Given this interpretation, Labor Secretary Doak explained that "the only course we had was to resort to legislation." McCarl had also reviewed early versions of the Davis-Bacon Act (not entirely favorably) and suggested certain refinements.
Although his advice was not acted upon initially, the issues raised continued to exist and formed the basis for ongoing GAO interest in the statute. Under the Davis-Bacon Act, the General Accounting Office (GAO) is responsible for debarment of contractors found in violation and manages certain aspects of federal expenditures related to this act (40 U.S.C. 276a(2)). Additionally, GAO has broader oversight functions concerning federal spending. Thus, beyond historical context, the agency has legitimate reasons to remain engaged with the act.  On June 12, 1962, J. E. Welch, a Deputy General Counsel of GAO, testified before the Roosevelt Subcommittee during their oversight hearings on the Davis-Bacon Act. Welch noted that since 1935, "GAO has examined or passed upon practically every Davis-Bacon case in which irregularities have been reported." He also stated that GAO's experience suggests that the Department of Labor's (DOL) methods and procedures for administering the act had not kept pace with the evolving requirements. However, Welch assured the panel that GAO was neutral on whether the Davis-Bacon Act should be continued or repealed.  A lengthy discussion aimed to clarify the relationship between GAO and DOL regarding the administration of the act. Although no clear conclusion emerged, it became evident that the two agencies were not operating in harmony. Welch pointed out ongoing negotiations between the Comptroller General, the Solicitor at DOL, and their aides, which seemed more focused on identifying disagreements rather than resolving conflicts. He concluded that if DOL was to retain final responsibility for the act, this should be accomplished through appropriate amendments.  GAO and the Subcommittee seemingly set aside the issue at this point. However, GAO supplemented its oral testimony with extensive documentation questioning DOL's administration of the act. Starting in the early 1960s, a series of critical reports from GAO highlighted perceived flaws in DOL’s implementation of the Federal prevailing wage law. With each report, GAO's dissatisfaction grew. Finally, on April 27, 1979, it published an extended summary review titled "The Davis-Bacon Act Should Be Repealed." The report was immediately controversial; some questioned the basis of its scholarship and debated whether GAO had the authority to challenge a policy that Congress had reaffirmed for nearly half a century.
Nonetheless, this latter study, alongside several earlier reports, served as a rich resource for critics of the Davis-Bacon Act. In advocating for Congress to reverse its support for the act, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) outlined several arguments. First, it argued that "significant changes in economic conditions and the economic character of the construction industry since 1931, combined with the passage of other wage laws, make the act unnecessary." Second, after nearly five decades, the Department of Labor (DOL) was deemed to have "not developed an effective program to issue and maintain current and accurate wage determinations; it may be impractical to ever achieve this goal." Third, the GAO argued that "the act results in unnecessary construction and administrative costs of several hundred million dollars annually (if the reviewed projects are representative), and has an inflationary effect on the areas covered by inaccurate wage rates and the economy as a whole."  Despite its influence, judging from its frequent citation, the 1979 GAO report did not win universal approval. During June 1979 hearings, several Members of Congress questioned the GAO's activist stance. Representative Frank Thompson (D-N.J.) asked Comptroller General Elmer Staats how much of the GAO’s work was undertaken at its own initiative. Staats responded that he believed "all of these" Davis-Bacon studies had been conducted at GAO's own discretion.  Ray Marshall, an economist from the University of Texas and Secretary of Labor when the report was released, criticized it as "very sloppy economic analysis with little credibility." The GAO defended its analysis but noted that "[w]ith minor exceptions [DOL] ... disagreed with almost everything presented in this report." Three congressional committees conducted hearings on Davis-Bacon during this period, focusing heavily on the GAO report. At each hearing, DOL and GAO representatives voiced areas of disagreement regarding the report and the act. Although these hearings did not resolve the methodological and interpretative conflicts surrounding the act, they increased its visibility.  Coverage disputes from the early 1960s (whether to apply Davis-Bacon or Walsh-Healey labor standards protections) were never fully resolved. As previously mentioned, Congress passed the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA) in 1965, extending labor standards requirements to federal service contracts. Amendments to the SCA were adopted in 1972 and 1976, each time over contractor objections. Thus, the jurisdictional issue became a three-way contest among these statutes.  These statutes, while similar and complementary, have different regulatory and economic impacts.
The application of specific statutes to various projects was a matter of considerable interest for employers, workers, federal agencies as consumers of construction and goods/services, and taxpayers. In 1974, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established an inter-agency task force to review the implementation of the McNamara-O'Hara Act; however, when the review concluded, the Department of Labor (DOL) did not concur with its findings, resulting in a stalemate. In January 1977, during the transition from the Ford to Carter Administrations, OMB issued a unilateral directive mandating administrative changes. This was later rescinded two weeks later when OFPP withdrew the directive due to the need for the new Administration to consider the issues involved.  In the summer of 1978, disputes arose between OFPP and DOL. The OFPP Administrator informed the Department of Defense (DOD) that contracts for the overhaul and rebuilding of certain aircraft engines would be governed by the Walsh-Healey Act rather than the locally prevailing rate under McNamara-O'Hara. In response, the House Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations initiated hearings in August 1978, following which OFPP withdrew its directive at the request of several key Members of Congress and referred the matter to Attorney General Griffin Bell for a legal decision regarding OFPP's authority. In March 1979, Bell ruled in favor of DOL, affirming that whether a particular class of contracts falls under Walsh-Healey or the Service Contract Act (SCA) is determined by the Secretary of Labor. However, he noted that the Secretary was subject to presidential supervision and direction as Chief Executive.  In June 1979, another interagency dispute emerged when DOL notified the General Services Administration (GSA) that automatic data processing contracts would be subject to SCA prevailing wage standards. The Department of Defense objected on grounds that meeting these standards would increase wages and disrupt industry salary structures, a stance echoed by industry representatives. This led to conflicts between contractors, contracting agencies, and DOL.  At this point, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report arguing against applying McNamara-O'Hara to service employees in data processing and high-technology firms. Industry took a firmer position, threatening not to enter federal automatic data processing contracts if DOL insisted that SCA applied to workers in these fields. This prevented an outright clash.  Given the Bell decision, such policy conflicts were left for President Carter's resolution. In August 1978, OFPP convened an Inter-Agency Task Force to review the operation of Davis-Bacon and SCA.
On May 28, 1982, final regulations were published to take effect on July 27, 1982. In a memorandum to Vice President George Bush and members of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief (chaired by the Vice President), Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan affirmed that "the final rule would be very well received by contractor groups." He also acknowledged that labor might react unfavorably.  Secretary Donovan’s predictions were accurate. Organized labor accused the new regulations of being a “back door attempt to nullify the law.” The AFL-CIO's Executive Council stated that these regulations amounted to "a laundry list of virtually every proposal offered over the years" by contractor associations. In contrast, the Chamber of Commerce’s Washington Report viewed them as a "major improvement," noting that businesses including construction trade associations had long sought to abolish or amend the Davis-Bacon law and its implementing regulations. The Associated Builders and Contractors approved, saying, “These new regulations will definitely make it easier and more desirable for contractors to bid on federal projects.”  The May 28, 1982, regulations addressed several key policy areas:  First, under the pre-Reagan system, a wage rate paid to 30% of the workers in a craft in a locality could be termed "prevailing" for Davis-Bacon purposes. The “30 percent” rule was now replaced by a “50 percent” rule.  Second, it had been claimed that DOL improperly set locally prevailing wage rates by “importing” urban rates for rural projects. The new regulations imposed strict limits on this practice.  Third, in determining Davis-Bacon wage rates, DOL had allegedly included wages from other federal (Davis-Bacon-covered) projects, a charge which suggested the potential to increase base rates.  Fourth, the regulations broadened the use of “helpers” (unskilled, general utility workers) on federal construction projects. Industry argued that this would reduce costs, provide work options for unskilled laborers, and offer employers greater flexibility. Labor countered that it could lead to craft fragmentation, decrease employment of skilled workers, and lower pay for those working on federal contract construction.  Fifth, the Copeland “anti-kickback” Act of 1934 required contractors to file weekly payroll reports and affirm compliance with Davis-Bacon requirements. The new regulations retained the affirmation but mandated submission of payroll records only in enforcement/compliance actions.  All these changes were opposed by organized labor.
The provisions addressing the "helper" regulations and the Copeland Act's reporting requirements were crucial for the unions. On June 11, 1982, the Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL-CIO, along with other entities, filed a lawsuit to prevent the implementation of these new regulations. Just as the regulations were set to take effect on July 22, 1982, Judge Harold Greene of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a preliminary injunction. On December 23, 1982, Judge Greene made a final decision that was largely favorable to the unions. He ruled in favor of Secretary Donovan regarding the substitution of the "50 percent" rule for the traditional "30 percent" rule but declared the regulations invalid and permanently enjoined their enforcement. Judge Greene stated that fifteen Secretaries of Labor, over eight administrations, had never changed the regulatory scheme. He argued that Secretary Donovan's claim to have found a different congressional intent was unfounded given historical context.  Both parties appealed. In January 1983, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the DOL, contested Judge Greene’s decision. Simultaneously, the BCTD announced its intention to appeal the favorable portion of Judge Greene's decision concerning the "30 percent" rule. On July 5, 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a split decision. It noted that while the legislative history was not clear, it suggested that Congress intended the Secretary’s authority to determine prevailing wages to encompass finding the best method for doing so.  The court generally deferred to the Secretary's authority:  1. The "50 percent" rule and/or averaging procedures were allowed. 2. The exclusion of distant urban data from rural wage rate calculations was upheld. 3. Wage data from federal projects could be excluded unless no suitable alternative existed. 4. Partial approval was given for the new rules on the use of "helpers," with a requirement that DOL revise the proposed regulation. A revised final rule dealing with "helpers" was promulgated by DOL on January 24, 1989, and gained court approval.  However, Congress ultimately failed to fund implementation of the "helper" rule, leaving it unresolved.
The Appeals Court agreed with the District Court that the changes to the reporting requirements under the Copeland Act would undermine Davis-Bacon enforcement, contradict statutory intent, and thus exceed the Secretary’s authority. Despite this, the Department continued experimenting with language to alter these requirements, which became a focus of several legislative proposals, none of which were enacted. Over time, the Copeland reporting issue appeared to fade from the policy agenda, leaving the previous requirements intact. The U.S. Supreme Court in January 1984 declined to hear an appeal by the Building Trades, indicating that DOL's "reform" efforts had been upheld in three out of five areas but denied in two areas: the “helper” issue and Copeland reporting requirements.  As discussed earlier, there were two suspensions during the first six decades of the act’s history. In 1934, President Roosevelt suspended it briefly for administrative convenience, while in 1971, President Nixon did so temporarily as part of his wage/price control strategy.  In early 1992, reports suggested that a third suspension might be considered under President George Bush's authority. Initial consideration began in the first months of the year, and by June, it was reported that a nationwide suspension was "more likely than not." However, this issue soon faded from public view.  On October 14, 1992, President Bush, via Proclamation 6491, suspended Davis-Bacon for specific jurisdictions in Florida, Louisiana, and Hawaii. He declared these areas to be experiencing a "national emergency" due to recent hurricanes, Andrew and Iniki. The suspension was intended to continue until further notice.  In justifying the suspension, President Bush added elements to define a national emergency. He argued that it could enhance employment opportunities by creating an estimated five to eleven thousand new jobs in construction. Additionally, he framed it as an economic measure, noting that paying the locally prevailing wage would increase rebuilding costs in those regions.
If the Davis-Bacon Act were suspended, more construction companies would be eligible to bid on Federal contracts. Additionally, there are potential racial/ethnic implications; for over half a century, the act has set non-market wage rates in the construction industry, effectively excluding semi-skilled workers, including many African-Americans, Hispanics, and new immigrants, from federal projects. Moreover, the suspension order cited financial concerns, arguing that adhering to local wage settlements had increased costs by billions of dollars.  The assumptions underlying the suspension were debatable and quickly drew criticism. Some believed that Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki might have been used as a pretext for an action already in consideration. Opinions on the suspension varied widely; segments of the construction industry, particularly those with non-union affiliations, supported it, suggesting economic benefits if the act was suspended nationwide. However, organized labor opposed the move, viewing it as a "desperate attempt" to gain political support in Florida and Louisiana.  Representative William Ford (D-Mich.), Chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, criticized the Bush proclamation, alleging that it used the residents' desperation as an opportunity to cut wages and please contributors from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He pledged to investigate the action when the new 103rd Congress convened.  Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), affected by the suspension, introduced legislation calling for the President to revise the proclamation to remove references to Hawaii and Hurricane Iniki. Many Members of Congress had long criticized the Davis-Bacon Act, suggesting that a complete repeal might be preferable if a temporary suspension proved beneficial. Early in the 103rd Congress, Senator Larry Craig (R-Ida.) proposed total repeal.  At this critical time for deficit reduction, Senator Craig argued that repealing the act altogether could lead to more sustainable outcomes.
I would like to propose to this President that, if he genuinely intends to make substantial budget cuts, reduce the deficit, and decrease the debt, one approach could be to place federal construction on par with private construction. Early in the 103rd Congress, the concerns of Representative Ford and Senator Inouye were addressed when President Clinton issued Proclamation No. 6534 on March 6, 1993, reversing his predecessor's suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act.  The 1992-1993 suspension had been recommended to President Bush as a policy measure since spring 1992, well before hurricane strikes. His initial response was mixed, but whether his ultimate decision to suspend the act was primarily due to storm-related developments or broader policy considerations is now less relevant. Other questions persist.  What constitutes a "national emergency" for suspending the Davis-Bacon Act? What was Congress's intent regarding this issue? Can the concept of "national emergency" under Davis-Bacon justify suspensions for regional or local emergencies, such as earthquakes or floods, which may have only indirect national impacts? Is the President's suspension authority limited to the Davis-Bacon Act itself, or can it extend to other program statutes that incorporate its provisions? In areas with state and local prevailing wage requirements, how might these be affected by a presidential suspension of Davis-Bacon?  If a President were to suspend the act, how long could such a suspension remain in effect? Traditionally, suspensions have been brief, but they may persist as long as the current President remains in office. Legal questions surrounding these suspensions are likely to lead to litigation, especially if the duration is extended.  The Davis-Bacon Act would continue to be contentious throughout the 1990s. Some aspects of the Reagan-era changes remained unresolved, particularly the "helper" issue. Persistent concerns arose regarding the wage rate determination process. Simultaneously, some advocated for repealing the statute, while others argued it needed strengthening. Each Congress brought new challenges and debates.  With the 1994 elections, the Republicans gained control of both houses of Congress, making Davis-Bacon a top priority.
As bills were introduced in both houses, the Engineering News-Record (ENR) reported on Republican strategies to challenge the Davis-Bacon Act through hearings on two proposed repeal measures. Clear divisions emerged: one group advocated immediate repeal, while another favored comprehensive reform. Committees swiftly scheduled hearings, with some predicting significant legislative action.  On January 4, 1995, Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.), newly appointed chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, introduced S. 141, a straightforward bill to repeal both the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts. In her remarks, Senator Kassebaum deemed the act "outdated," arguing that it ill-serves the public by imposing restrictive wage rate and work rule requirements. A hearing was held on February 15, followed by markup and reporting of the bill on March 29.  Concurrently, similar legislation appeared in the House. On January 13, 1995, Representative Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.) introduced H.R. 500, which not only aimed to repeal both acts but also sought to remove Davis-Bacon requirements from all federal laws where they were incorporated. Ballenger contended that repealing the act would reduce construction costs by allowing lower wages for workers and enable the government to fund more projects with existing budgets. The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, chaired by Representative Ballenger, and marked up and reported by the full Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities on March 2.  Initial momentum suggested a push towards repeal, but support was not as unified as it seemed. On August 11, 1995, Senator Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), chair of the Appropriations Committee, introduced S. 1183, titled "Davis-Bacon Act Reform Amendments of 1995," alongside five other Republican senators. Hatfield presented this legislation as a balanced compromise acceptable to both major parties: construction trade unions and contractors' coalitions. He noted his previous support for the prevailing wage concept, acknowledging that while the current Davis-Bacon Act faces valid criticism, it deserved some reform.
Nonetheless, its primary goal—to safeguard jobs for our nation's construction workers—compels us to advocate for reform rather than repeal of the act. Senator Hatfield elucidated that the bill emerged from "lengthy and arduous" negotiations among industry and labor representatives in Oregon, which continued during the summer of 1995 in Washington. He proposed three amendments to the existing statute: first, raising the threshold at which the act applies to federal projects from $2,000 to $100,000; second, changing the frequency of contractors' wage and benefit schedule filings from weekly to monthly; third, excluding trainees and apprentices from prevailing wage standards if they are enrolled in a Department of Labor-registered training program. The bill also included other provisions aimed at tightening or redefining coverage. Hatfield argued that rather than repeal Davis-Bacon, S. 1183 would revise the measure "to serve its original and commendable purpose."  As autumn advanced into 1995, Congress continued to consider Davis-Bacon while addressing budget and appropriations measures, as well as various program statutes. On October 12, Representative Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) introduced H.R. 2472: companion legislation to the Hatfield bill. Like its predecessor, it was initially supported by Republican Members of the House. Weldon highlighted that the bill had 27 cosponsors and garnered support from organized labor and major contracting corporations across the country. He emphasized Davis-Bacon's benefits for both workers and industry, asserting that repeal would jeopardize construction workers' quality of life.  Both bills (S. 1183 and H.R. 2472) ultimately failed to pass at the conclusion of the 104th Congress, marking a significant halt in the movement for their repeal. It was reported that more than 14,000 contractors joined a coalition with construction unions advocating for reform rather than repeal. By the end of the 20th century, despite continued introduction of repeal proposals, they were not acted upon. Some oversight hearings were conducted, but Congress primarily focused on the Davis-Bacon provisions in program statutes. With this more targeted agenda, no changes were made to the prevailing wage statute.  In late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina intensified in the Caribbean and approached Florida and the Gulf Coast, leading to one of the United States' greatest natural disasters. As assessments progressed, it became clear that New Orleans had been particularly hard hit.
The suspension would continue "until otherwise provided." Representative Charlie Norwood (R-GA) commended the President for his "swift action to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy that could impede recovery efforts...." According to Davis-Bacon rules, he argued, they "are burdensome and increase project costs unnecessarily...." He emphasized that "the nation cannot afford such inefficiencies, red tape, and inflated expenses when rebuilding a whole region at taxpayer expense." The Daily Labor Report quoted the President, suggesting that the suspension would provide greater assistance to devastated communities and enable the employment of thousands more individuals. Representative Feeney reportedly stated: "Many people in Louisiana are ready to work tomorrow, and market forces should set wages...."  Organized labor maintained that the President's order would allow contractors to pay substandard wages to construction workers in affected areas. AFL-CIO president John Sweeney expressed concern, saying that "employers are too eager to exploit workers." He further argued that taking advantage of a national tragedy to remove worker protections is "nothing less than profiteering." Edward Sullivan, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department, likened this effect to "legalized looting."  The New York Times editorialized that "By any standard of human decency, condemning many already poor people to sub-par wages—thus perpetuating their poverty—is unacceptable."  Anticipating the President's action, Representative Flake introduced the Cleanup and Reconstruction Enhancement Act (CARE Act) on September 7, 2005. This bill, H.R. 3684, proposed automatically suspending the Davis-Bacon Act for one year in disaster areas whenever a major disaster is declared under the Stafford Act. A companion bill, S. 1817, was introduced by Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC).  In response to the President's action, several bills were introduced to overturn his proclamation: H.R. 3763 (George Miller), H.R. 3834 (Frank Pallone, D-NJ), and S. 1739 (Edward Kennedy, D-MA). Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) proposed a two-pronged bill, S. 1763, to prioritize employment for displaced workers from Hurricane Katrina and restore the Davis-Bacon Act's protections in affected areas.  In addition to these bills targeting the Davis-Bacon Act specifically, Representative Miller introduced H.Res., which seemed to challenge the Administration’s policy.
During the late 20th century and early 21st century, numerous aspects of the administration of the Davis-Bacon Act have remained contentious, with most disputes tracing their origins to legislation enacted in 1931 and 1935. Initially, it was widely assumed that the Department of Labor could easily determine prevailing wages when stakeholders, including employers and workers, failed to agree on local wage rates. However, wage rate determination has consistently been a central issue under the Davis-Bacon Act, remaining unresolved to this day.  Similarly, worker classification has also proven to be an ongoing point of contention, particularly with late 1970s proposals regarding "helpers" and apprentices. Worker classifications significantly impact their pay rates and may reflect employers' attitudes towards trade unions and collective bargaining. Classification issues have persisted alongside the interpretation of statutory provisions; for instance, defining the "site of work" under Davis-Bacon requirements or determining how to handle "off-site" work. Additionally, there are questions regarding whether truck drivers should be covered by Davis-Bacon regulations.  Further complexities arise from the integration of the Davis-Bacon Act into various program statutes, often through inclusion of a prevailing wage provision within them. This has created opportunities for disputes over the extent of worker protection and the interplay between Davis-Bacon and related procurement statutes such as the Walsh-Healey Act and the McNamara-O'Hara Act.  In the 1990s and beyond, ongoing debates have centered on the economic impact of the Davis-Bacon Act. If repealed, federal agencies could potentially save money by paying construction workers lower wages. However, eliminating the act might also increase labor costs or project expenses in other ways. The act's regulations are believed to foster higher quality workmanship, productivity, and a reduced need for remedial actions. Moreover, there is an ongoing discussion about whether Davis-Bacon supports skill transfers through apprenticeship training programs.
How are different worker groups—such as women, minorities, unskilled laborers, and non-union workers—affected by the Davis-Bacon Act? Despite 75 years of legislative hearings and floor discussions, it appears there is still no clear verdict. Moreover, solid empirical data to support an assessment seems limited. Often, during each session of Congress, the issue resurfaces with unqualified assertions of impact, both positive and negative, frequently without substantive supporting evidence.  Since the 1930s, doubts have been expressed regarding the necessity of the Davis-Bacon Act and the Department of Labor's capacity to enforce it reasonably. For most of its history, such criticism was generally muted. In the 1950s, as provisions were increasingly included in program statutes, critics became more vocal, a trend that continued into the 1960s through the 1980s. By the mid-1990s, it seemed there might be some progress towards repealing or significantly revising the act. However, this perception changed around the turn of the millennium; debate cooled, though criticism persisted.  Numerous hearings and floor debates have been held on Davis-Bacon, along with extensive literature—studies, reports, and analyses. Nevertheless, congressional policy has consistently leaned toward expanding coverage and strengthening the act. Certain policy issues regarding Davis-Bacon have remained contentious over the years, many of which were debated in the 1930s using similar terms and prompting similar calls for administrative or legislative action.  While the growing body of pro and con literature offers little new insight, it has not fully illuminated critical aspects of the act's administration and impact. The Davis-Bacon Act is now an integral part of wage structures and contracting practices in the construction industry. Uncertainty remains about the potential effects of repealing or significantly modifying the act.  Further inquiry might also consider whether any changes to the Davis-Bacon Act should extend to related statutes, such as the Walsh-Healey and McNamara-O'Hara Acts.  As we move into the 21st century, additional factors may influence debates over the Davis-Bacon Act or alter their nature.
Some believe that there is a gradual decline in both the membership and political influence of trade unions, which could lead to reduced public and congressional support for the Davis-Bacon Act. If this perception holds true, labor's legislative priorities might shift.  Moreover, the Davis-Bacon Act was originally designed to promote stability within the construction industry while safeguarding labor standards. Could its repeal or modification introduce uncertainties regarding wages in bid evaluation processes? Would it alter workforce utilization patterns and increase workplace accidents? Additionally, would it diminish the effectiveness of apprenticeship programs that currently resolve skill development and transfer issues under Davis-Bacon coverage?  Over time, there has been a demographic shift among members of Congress, policy analysts, trade union leaders, and others. The experiences and perspectives of earlier generations, particularly those from before World War II, are no longer fully shared or appreciated by the newer generation. With the retirement of the 1930s and 1940s’ generation (and their historical insights), there might be a lack of understanding for certain labor protection statutes. Consequently, if laws such as the Davis-Bacon Act are to persist, they may need renewed justification through education or experience, which could include some challenging lessons.  Furthermore, the reemergence of federal deficits and budgetary constraints due to security concerns might lead to a more critical review of past assumptions. As a result, statutes that are perceived as imposing unnecessary costs or presenting significant enforcement challenges might face alterations or abolition in favor of newer programs deemed more relevant to younger constituencies.  Given all these considerations, it would be beneficial to revisit the evolution of the Davis-Bacon Act and other federal labor standards laws to establish a rational framework for reassessment and guide future public policy directions.
On May 26, 1994, during the early twentieth century, Haiti faced a chaotic political environment and persistent financial mismanagement, with eighty percent of its budget devoted to debt service. This situation prompted concerns among U.S. government officials that their citizens' financial obligations might not be met. Additionally, there was fear that one of the warring European powers—particularly France or Germany—might establish an influence in Haiti, potentially leading to naval bases that could threaten access to the newly constructed Panama Canal. Following World War I and a breakdown in Haitian authority due to bloody factional struggles in the summer of 1915, the Woodrow Wilson administration decided to intervene.  In July 1915, Admiral William B. Caperton, aboard the battleship Washington, was instructed to land troops to restore order and take administrative control of customhouses. Within hours, a landing party of approximately 330 sailors and marines secured the capital with minimal resistance; there were only two U.S. fatalities, possibly due to friendly fire, while Haitian casualties were also low. Admiral Caperton subsequently directed additional U.S. forces to control other coastal areas, quelling guerrilla resistance in mountainous regions by capturing Fort Rivière in November. By year-end 1915, the marine presence was significantly reduced.  Throughout most of the occupation, from 1915 to 1934, a force of about 1,200-1,400 marines performed garrison duty with some patrolling. After securing major population centers, U.S. officials facilitated the election by the Haitian National Assembly of Philippe Sudre Dartiguenave as an agreeable president, who had previously served as the president of the Haitian Senate. Amid continued unrest, Admiral Caperton established censorship and martial law, measures that remained in place for over a decade.  To ensure orderly governance, the United States proposed a treaty allowing a U.S.-appointed official to collect taxes and manage debt repayments and other disbursements. This treaty was ratified by Haiti in November 1915 and by the U.S. Senate in February 1916. It also created a constabulary (or gendarmerie) consisting of native Haitians under American direction, serving as both military and police forces. The treaty remained effective for ten years, extendable for another ten if its objectives were not fully achieved. In March 1917, the duration was officially extended to twenty years.  Despite these measures, the Haitian National Assembly's relationship with the U.S. remained contentious.
The State Department drafted a new Haitian Constitution in 1917 that would validate U.S. occupation and permit foreigners to own property in Haiti. When the assembly refused to ratify it, Lt. Col. Smedley D. Butler, a U.S. Marine officer serving with the Haitian Gendarmerie, dissolved the assembly by reading a dissolution order Dartiguenave had been pressured into signing upon entry to the capital in June 1917. To avoid another election, U.S. authorities approved the new constitution through a plebiscite in June 1918; only 769 votes out of 100,000 were negative. The new constitution established a Council of State, appointed by the Haitian president, to perform legislative functions until a reconstituted assembly could be convened.  Despite U.S. control over major towns, guerrilla bands known as cacos (named after a local bird) remained active in the mountainous interior. These groups had long been politically significant, often supporting various factions among the dominant francophone elite. Renewed attacks by cacos began in October 1918 and continued for several months, including an attack on Port-au-Prince in October 1919, until U.S. forces, including marines and Gendarmerie, neutralized them through frequent patrols, offering bounties for surrendered weapons, and eliminating their leaders. After 1920, caco attacks were infrequent.  The Gendarmerie, renamed the Garde d'Haiti in 1928, became a crucial part of Haiti's administrative structure. Initially officered by Americans—largely marine enlisted men—who were paid by both the U.S. Marine Corps and Haiti, the Gendarmerie numbered between 2,000 to 2,600 members and was deployed throughout the country. It maintained law and order, settled disputes, supported public works projects, and served as Haiti's military force. Gradually, U.S. officers were replaced by Haitians, a process that accelerated after 1929.  Historians acknowledge that under U.S. occupation, Haitians enjoyed greater security in their persons and property than ever before. The Gendarmerie functioned effectively and impartially during the occupation. After U.S. forces departed in 1934, Haitian officers became increasingly involved in political activities. Throughout the occupation, U.S. forces suffered minimal casualties—10 killed, 26 wounded, with 172 other incidents—and faced complaints of brutality that led to congressional hearings in 1922. The special committee largely dismissed serious charges and concluded most abuses occurred during the suppression of the caco insurrection from 1918 to 1919. This counterinsurgency effort resulted in estimated deaths of over 2,000 cacos.
(3) Although officially denying that cruelty was condoned, the committee noted at least ten instances of illegal executions by American forces during the suppression of the Caco rebellion. After this period, there were virtually no attacks on U.S. marines or civilians by Haitians. Following a 1922 congressional investigation criticizing lack of coordination among U.S. officials in Haiti, civilian and military authority was consolidated. General John H. Russell, USMC, served as the senior marine and U.S. High Commissioner from 1922 to 1930, responsible to the State Department. Reporting to him were U.S. officials (technically appointed by the Haitian President) managing finance, public works, sanitation, agriculture, and serving as chief of the Gendarmerie. Described as a conscientious yet imperious officer, General Russell became the most powerful figure in Haiti. He was later appointed Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps.  The Great Depression and decreased markets for Haitian products, particularly coffee, led to economic hardships and increased unrest among a long-disenfranchised population. Riots in Les Cayes in December 1929 threatened to spread nationwide. A detachment from the Marine Brigade was sent to Port-au-Prince to restore order but resulted in at least twelve Haitian deaths. Subsequent incidents were contained without loss of life, but the Hoover Administration feared involvement in hostilities that U.S. public opinion might not support.  In early 1930, President Hoover appointed a bipartisan commission headed by W. Cameron Forbes, previously Governor General of the Philippines, to investigate conditions in Haiti. After several weeks in the country and gathering testimony from all sectors of society, the commission submitted a report arguing that the United States could not relinquish its responsibilities for ensuring Haiti's financial stability but proposed changes such as separating civil and military responsibilities, increasing Haitian representation in government, and reducing intervention in domestic affairs.  In November 1929, General Russell was replaced by State Department official Dana G. Munro, who became Minister rather than High Commissioner. An Executive Agreement was negotiated in 1932 providing for the complete Haitianization of the Garde by October 1934 and the withdrawal of the Marine Brigade two years before the extended 1915 Treaty expired. Despite these arrangements, Washington aimed to withdraw from Haiti earlier. Elections were held in October 1930, returning a strongly nationalistic majority. The complete Haitianization of the Garde was achieved by then. President Franklin Roosevelt visited Cap-Haitien in July 1934, and all remaining marines departed the following month.  Nevertheless, a U.S.
The financial adviser remained until 1941 to oversee payments on Haiti's debt. The U.S. occupation significantly stabilized Haitian finances and secured investments for American interests, especially after World War I ended any threat of European intervention. In 1922, a $16 million loan was negotiated to consolidate Haiti’s foreign debts, which improved the efficiency of duty collection and ensured prompt payments to U.S. banks. Under U.S. supervision, about 60% of Haitian revenues were used for debt repayment, with some critics arguing that more could have been invested in domestic projects. However, consensus exists regarding the honest handling of finances during the occupation.  In the 1920s, annual government revenues doubled from pre-occupation levels to $8-10 million, and coffee production and small businesses expanded. Yet, a solid long-term economic base was not established due to limited progress in land management and lack of accurate titles. The U.S. also completed numerous public works projects after 1920, including road construction that often relied on forced labor or corvée. These roads facilitated transportation at a time when automobiles were increasingly common in Haiti. Port facilities, lighthouses, and dredging of harbors were improved. Agricultural productivity efforts faced challenges due to small land holdings.  The U.S. aimed to provide modern healthcare access to the majority of Haitians through a National Public Health Service with clinics and hospitals supervised by American doctors. This initiative was partly financed by Haiti under U.S. encouragement. Despite these efforts, the U.S. did not focus on building democracy or promoting local self-government. Prior to the occupation, the Haitian government largely relied on a narrow elite of around 5% of the population.
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, which is Title XVI of the Social Security Act, was established in 1972 and began implementation in 1974 to ensure a minimum cash income for aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Eligibility for SSI is based on limited income and resources, with recipients being either aged or disabled adults or couples. For adults, disability is defined as an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in death or last at least 12 months. The worker must also be unable to perform any kind of work existing in the national economy, considering their age, education, and experience. Children under 18 may qualify if they have an impairment resulting in "marked and severe" functional limitations. Adults aged 65 or older can receive SSI benefits without being disabled.  Administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the SSI program operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. To be eligible for SSI, an individual must be a U.S. citizen or a "qualified alien," residing in the United States or the Northern Mariana Islands, a child of a person stationed outside the country in the military, or a temporary student abroad. Additional requirements include residence status, absence from the U.S., application for other benefits, and exclusion from certain public institutions.  As of December 2013, there were over 8.3 million SSI recipients, with more than 1.3 million children under 18, nearly 5.0 million adults between ages 18 and 64, and just over 2.1 million adults aged 65 or older receiving benefits totaling over $4.6 billion.  The maximum federal SSI payment, known as the Federal Benefit Rate (FBR), was $721 per month for individuals living independently in 2014 and $1,082 for couples living independently. While all but six states and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands supplement the FBR with additional payments, four states and the District of Columbia have SSA-administered state supplements, and 34 states self-manage their supplementary benefits.  Federal SSI benefit maximums are adjusted annually using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) to reflect changes in the cost of living.
Hedge funds are essentially unregulated mutual funds that pool invested money to buy and sell a wide variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, foreign currencies, precious metals, commodities, and derivatives. Some hedge funds specialize in specific strategies (such as mortgage bonds or East Asian markets), while others, known as macro funds, invest globally where opportunities for profit are identified. To avoid SEC regulation, they accept funding only from "accredited investors," defined by the SEC as individuals with at least $1 million in assets. Hedge funds also benefit from statutory exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which governs public mutual funds. Unlike regulated mutual funds that must adhere to a comprehensive set of regulations to protect small, unsophisticated investors—such as limits on borrowing, strict record-keeping rules, capital structure requirements, specified investment goals and strategies, bonding requirements, and shareholder approval procedures for certain business activities—hedge funds generally limit their investor base to 99 accredited individuals. The National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 further allowed hedge funds to have an unlimited number of partners if each partner was a "qualified purchaser" with at least $5 million in invested assets.  Most hedge funds are structured as limited partnerships, featuring one or more general partners who also manage the fund. Often former employees of large securities firms, these managers seek greater entrepreneurial freedom and financial rewards. Hedge fund managers typically earn 15%-25% of the fund's profits plus an annual management fee of 1%-2% of total assets. Data on hedge funds is available from several private sources, but estimates vary significantly in size. Prior to the 2007 financial crisis, there were approximately 8,000-9,000 hedge funds managing around $2 trillion in assets.
Significant numbers of hedge funds have closed due to substantial losses experienced during the 2008 bear markets; George Soros, a renowned hedge fund manager, estimates that the managed capital could shrink by up to 75%. Starting a hedge fund is relatively straightforward, and with successful performance over a few quarters, new managers can attract capital through fees from both performance and management. Due to their high-risk investments aimed at achieving high returns, many hedge funds have a short life span. Research indicates an annual attrition rate of about 20%, with the average lifespan estimated at three years. The average annual return for hedge funds varies; some studies suggest they generally outperform benchmarks like the S&P 500, while others indicate underperformance. The frequent closure of many hedge funds introduces significant challenges in performance measurement, including survivorship bias—the exclusion of closed funds from return calculations. Annual return figures do not account for year-to-year and fund-to-fund variations. According to the law of averages, some funds will consistently perform well, which could explain their enduring popularity among investors despite high fees and risk. Investors understand that hedge funds are high-risk/high-return operations where they might experience losses; these investors either seek higher returns or portfolio diversification. As long as they are sophisticated and wealthy, current regulations stipulate, such losses should not raise public policy concerns. However, the 1998 case of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) offers an exception. This fund, headquartered in Connecticut with a Cayman Islands charter, achieved annual returns over 40% through 1996, but faced catastrophic losses of nearly $2 billion during August 1998 due to global market turmoil stemming from financial crises in Asia and Russia.
Systemic risks associated with hedge funds include the potential for failing funds to sell large volumes of securities at a time when liquidity is insufficient, leading to market "seizures." Moreover, lenders to hedge funds, including federally insured banks, could suffer significant losses if these funds default—questions have been raised about their ability to evaluate risk in lending to hedge funds. Additionally, defaults on derivatives contracts can disrupt markets and pose unforeseen risks to counterparties due to the lack of comprehensive regulatory oversight over derivative instruments. The limited public information on hedge fund portfolios and trading strategies can intensify market panic. LTCM exemplifies these dangers.  However, policymakers and regulators are also concerned about the potential positive impact of hedge funds. In foreign exchange markets, accusations have been made that hedge funds contributed to instability, such as during the European currency crises in the early 1990s and the Asian devaluations from 1997-1998. Hedge funds can borrow a currency and sell it, hoping to profit if the currency depreciates. If these sales are substantial relative to a country's foreign reserves, they could intensify pressure for devaluation, requiring the target country to take painful measures like increasing domestic interest rates, which can negatively affect stock markets and economic growth.  In the United States, where such speculative raids have not occurred, some argue that attributing crises to hedge funds is akin to blaming messengers who deliver bad news. Speculators' profit opportunities are often created by poor economic policies. The relationship between speculation and price volatility remains unresolved in finance; while no conclusive evidence links speculation to increased volatility exists, the two phenomena frequently co-occur.  Hedge funds, as the most visible speculators today, have been met with suspicion from some regulators and market participants. In April 1999, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (comprising the Federal Reserve, SEC, CFTC, and Treasury) issued a report that highlighted LTCM as an example of how a single, heavily leveraged institution can threaten other institutions and the financial system. The report noted that commercial and investment banks' proprietary trading operations employ similar strategies in the same markets but are often larger and more highly leveraged than hedge funds.
The primary concern is how to manage excessive leverage. The Working Group determined that greater transparency from hedge funds was necessary, suggesting that large funds publish annual disclosure statements detailing their portfolio status and risk assessment. Public companies and financial institutions were advised to include in their quarterly and annual reports a statement of their exposure to hedge funds and other highly leveraged entities.  In 2003, following the rapid growth in hedge fund investment, an SEC staff report proposed that hedge funds register as investment advisers. This would enable regular examinations by the SEC, facilitating early detection and deterrence of fraud; provide basic information about hedge fund investments impacting significant markets; and ensure uniform standards for registered hedge funds to improve disclosures to investors.  On October 26, 2004, the SEC adopted a rule requiring hedge funds to register under the Investment Advisers Act. This decision was contentious: opponents argued that hedge fund investors are knowledgeable of risks, the SEC already has fraud-pursuit authority, systemic risk concerns are exaggerated, and the focus should be on encouraging mutual funds to adopt hedge fund strategies rather than regulating them.  The adopted rule did not meet all critics' expectations; it lacked real-time monitoring capabilities and could still face issues similar to those seen with Long-Term Capital Management. However, the SEC decided against direct regulation, as evidenced by the 2003 staff report's conclusion that there was no justification for such measures. The rule became effective on February 1, 2006, but in June 2006, an appeals court ruled it arbitrary and incompatible with the Investment Advisers Act, vacating it and compelling a reconsideration.  SEC Chairman Cox directed his professional staff to propose alternative solutions for consideration. Another pertinent issue is the "retailization" of hedge funds.
The Madoff case underscored the need for stricter regulation of investment advisers, including hedge funds. The Obama Administration's 2009 white paper, "Financial Regulatory Reform: A New Foundation," suggested that advisers managing hedge funds and other private pools of capital (such as private equity and venture capital funds) with substantial assets should register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. These advisers would be required to report sufficient information on their managed funds to assess potential threats to financial stability.  In the 109th Congress, H.R. 6079 (Representative Castle) directed the President's Working Group to study hedge fund growth, risks, leverage usage, and benefits. The Senate did not act on this bill. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 711 (Representatives Capuano and Castle) aimed to remove the Investment Advisers Act exemption for firms with fewer than 15 clients, requiring hedge funds managing more than $25 million in client funds to register with the SEC. H.R. 712 (Representative Castle) mandated defined benefit pension plans to disclose their investments in hedge funds. H.R. 713 (Representative Castle) instructed the President's Working Group on Financial Markets to study hedge fund regulation and report findings.  S. 344 (Senator Grassley) sought to limit exemptions under the Investment Company Act, requiring hedge funds managing over $50 million to register with the SEC. S. 506 and H.R. 1265 proposed changes to offshore fund tax treatment. S. 1276 required hedge fund managers to register as investment advisers for private equity and venture capital firms, authorizing the SEC to collect systemic risk data.  While hedge funds were not identified as a primary cause of the 2007 financial crisis, they are viewed as part of the "shadow" financial system that includes over-the-counter derivatives, non-bank lending, and other lightly or unregulated sectors. As part of comprehensive regulatory reform legislation in the 111th Congress, certain hedge funds would be required to register with the SEC and provide position and trading strategy information to systemic risk authorities.  Under H.R. 4173, passed by the House on December 11, 2009, managers of funds with over $150 million under management would be required to register as investment advisers with the SEC.
This statute authorizes the Secretary of a military department to make available military animals—specifically, military working dogs or horses owned by the Department of Defense—for adoption under certain conditions: (1) at the end of their useful life, (2) before the end of their useful life if unusual circumstances warrant it as determined by the Secretary, or (3) when they are excess to the needs of the department. Prior to 2000, military working dogs were typically caged for up to a year and then euthanized under Department of Defense policy. The statute was amended in 2006 to include horses.  Additionally, this statute establishes an African Elephant Conservation Fund from which the Secretary of the Interior can provide financial assistance for projects related to research, conservation, management, or protection of African elephants.  The statute also requires the imposition of a moratorium by the Secretary on the importation of raw and worked ivory from countries not meeting specified criteria, including being parties to CITES and adhering to its Ivory Control System. It imposes civil and criminal penalties for importing raw ivory from non-ivory producing countries or from countries under a moratorium.  Furthermore, any individual who furnishes information leading to a conviction or civil penalty under the act may be rewarded up to half of any resulting fine or $25,000, whichever is less.   Section 794 of P.L. 109-97 (2005) prohibits the use of funds made available by this act for personnel salaries and expenses related to inspecting horses under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. § 603) or under guidelines issued under section 903 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 1901 note; P.L. 104-127). Since the Federal Meat Inspection Act mandates that horses be inspected before slaughter for human consumption, this section restricts such inspections with funds from this act.  Effective 120 days after the enactment of this act, none of its funds can be used to pay personnel inspecting horses under the specified acts.
The passage from P.L. 109-97 effectively prohibited horse slaughter for human consumption in the United States between March 10, 2006, and September 30, 2006, by preventing appropriated funds from being used to pay inspectors' salaries and cover inspection expenses. However, on February 8, 2006, the Department of Agriculture issued a regulation (9 C.F.R. § 352.19) allowing slaughter plants to pay for inspections conducted by the Food Safety and Inspection Service, thereby permitting horse slaughters to continue. The 110th Congress subsequently enacted P.L. 110-161, which barred the Department of Agriculture from charging slaughter plants for inspections, effectively reinstating the ban on horse slaughter. This was achieved by prohibiting appropriated funds from paying for both Federal Meat Inspection Act and Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 salaries and expenses, as well as funding related to implementing or enforcing 9 C.F.R. § 352.19.  Additionally, this statute criminalizes shooting any animal while in an aircraft, as well as using an aircraft to harass animals, with some exceptions for government-employed personnel managing wildlife, land, water, domesticated animals, human life, or crops. It also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to designate zones within Alaska's national preserves where hunting, fishing, trapping, and entry are prohibited, and prohibits taking fish and wildlife in Alaskan national parks and monuments except as specified.  Furthermore, Section 1005 of this act, as amended in 1990, mandates close collaboration between the Secretary of the Interior and state officials to assess impacts on wildlife from oil and gas activities and other human uses, including effects on caribou herds, polar bears, muskoxen, and migratory birds.  Lastly, both P.L. 109-97 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, public services, and accommodations, encompassing reasonable accommodations such as permitting service animals like guide dogs.
For example, see 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(c). Additionally, refer to "Fair Housing Act," 42 U.S.C. § 3604, discussed later in this document. This statute grants the Secretary of Commerce authority to take various measures for protecting fishery resources. It also instructs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct investigations, experiments, and tests deemed necessary to determine, demonstrate, and promulgate the best methods of eradicating or controlling mountain lions, wolves, bobcats, prairie dogs, gophers, ground squirrels, jackrabbits, brown tree snakes, and other animals that are harmful to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, animal husbandry, wild game animals, fur-bearing animals, and birds. This statute was enacted in 1931 (with the addition of "brown tree snakes" in 1991). The Secretary's functions were transferred from Agriculture to Interior in 1939, then back to Agriculture in 1985. In 1987, P.L. 100-202 added provisions allowing the Secretary of Agriculture (excluding urban rodent control) to conduct activities and enter into agreements with states, local jurisdictions, individuals, and public or private agencies for controlling nuisance mammals and birds, as well as species that are reservoirs for zoonotic diseases. Agreement funds can be deposited into appropriate accounts immediately and remain available until expended for Animal Damage Control activities. This statute also mandates the Department of Agriculture to submit a preliminary report by June 23, 2001, and a final report by October 20, 2001, concerning foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases. Finally, this legislation, replacing the Animal Enterprise Protection Act of 1992, criminalizes traveling in interstate or foreign commerce or using mail or other facilities to damage or interfere with an animal enterprise's operations, intentionally damaging real or personal property, or placing a person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to themselves, family members, spouse, or intimate partner.
The statute defines "animal enterprise" as follows: (A) a commercial or academic operation involving animals or animal products for profit, food production, agriculture, education, research, or testing; (B) a zoo, aquarium, animal shelter, pet store, breeder, furrier, circus, rodeo, or other lawful competitive event featuring animals; or (C) any fair or similar event intended to promote agricultural advancements. This statute grants the Secretary of Agriculture authority to prohibit or restrict the importation or exportation of animals into or from the United States, the movement in interstate commerce of animals, and the use of conveyances for livestock transport if such actions are deemed necessary to prevent pest or disease introduction.  Additionally, the Secretary may order the destruction or removal of any animal, or seize, quarantine, or dispose of an animal, when needed. The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) empowers the Secretary of Agriculture to establish standards governing humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation of animals by dealers, research facilities, and exhibitors. These standards must include requirements to minimize animal pain and distress during experimental procedures.  The AWA also mandates that the Secretary promulgate standards for the transportation in commerce, as well as the handling, care, and treatment of animals consigned for transport by intermediate handlers, air carriers, or other entities. The definition of "animal" under the act encompasses any warm-blooded animal used for research, testing, experimentation, exhibition, or as a pet; however, it excludes birds, rats of the genus Rattus, and mice of the genus Mus bred specifically for research, horses not used in research, and other farm animals. Prior to 2002 amendments by P.L. 107-171 (Section 10301), these exclusions did not apply to birds, rats, or mice. Although regulations previously excluded these species from coverage under the act, a federal court ruled that this exclusion violated the law, but the decision was overturned due to lack of standing by the plaintiffs.  In an unrelated case, the en banc D.C. Circuit Court addressed further aspects of the AWA's application.
The Circuit Court ruled that a plaintiff who suffered injuries to their aesthetic interest in observing animals living under humane conditions had standing to sue the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). Subsequently, another lawsuit challenged the exclusion of birds, rats, and mice from protection, with a federal district court, citing the D.C. Circuit case, denying the Department of Agriculture's motion to dismiss for lack of standing. The Department responded by settling the case through revising its regulations to include these species. Congress then intervened, prohibiting FY2001 (P.L. 106-387, § 772) and FY2002 (P.L. 107-76, § 732) funds from being used to modify the AWA's animal definition. In addition, P.L. 107-171 amended the statute to exclude birds, rats, and mice bred for research. However, Section 10304 of the same law required the National Research Council by May 13, 2003, to submit a report on the implications of including these animals within the AWA's definition to the House and Senate Agriculture Committees—a report that has not been written.  The AWA mandates that every research facility must establish an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) with at least three members, one of whom is unaffiliated with the facility. This committee aims to represent "general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals." The IACUC's responsibilities include reviewing practices involving pain or distress to animals and filing a report with the Secretary.  The AWA also mandates licensing for dealers and exhibitors (7 U.S.C. § 2133) and prohibits research facilities from purchasing dogs or cats from unlicensed dealers or exhibitors (7 U.S.C. § 2137). "Dealer" is defined as a person who transports, buys, or sells animals for research, teaching, exhibition, or pet use, with the exception of retail pet stores not selling to these entities (7 U.S.C. § 2132(f)). The term "exhibitor" includes carnivals, circuses, and zoos but excludes retail pet stores, state and country fairs, livestock shows, rodeos, and purebred dog and cat shows (7 U.S.C. § 2132(g)).
Section 14207(b) of Title 110-234, as amended in 2008, increased the maximum penalty for violations from a fine and up to five years' imprisonment per offense. The Animal Welfare Act's animal fighting section prohibits knowingly using interstate commerce or mail to advertise an animal or a sharp instrument intended for use in an animal fighting venture, except that this prohibition applies only if the fight involves live birds and would be illegal under state law.   The statute also makes it unlawful for U.S. citizens, unless authorized by the Director of the National Science Foundation, to engage in commerce involving native animals or native birds taken from Antarctica, in compliance with the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.  This act establishes the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund and directs the Secretary of the Interior to use its funds for projects aimed at conserving Asian elephants. The statute further mandates that the Secretary of Commerce, working with the Secretary of the Interior, develop and implement a program supporting interstate fishery management efforts by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.  Additionally, it limits salmon fishing under the Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean. It directs the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to jointly declare a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass within state coastal waters that do not comply with the fish management plan adopted by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.  The statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to create regulations limiting the size and quantity of fish caught, as well as the incidental catch of regulated species. It also criminalizes possession, purchase, sale, or transport of bald or golden eagles, including their parts, nests, or eggs, except under specific regulatory exceptions for scientific, exhibition, religious, or conservation purposes.  Finally, the CHIMP Act, amended by P.L. 110-170 in 2007, added section 481C to the Public Health Service Act.
However, due to the inclusion of "or hereafter" in the language cited above, the prohibition on the use of funds persists unless it is repealed. Other Department of Defense appropriations statutes use the phrase "this Act or any other Act," instead of including "hereafter." The Comptroller General has ruled that the words "or any other Act" do not imply futurity but rather extend the provision's applicability to other available appropriations within the fiscal year. For instance, P.L. 103-139 §8044 (1993) and P.L. 104-61 §8034 (1995) state that none of the funds provided in this Act or any other Act shall be available to conduct bone trauma research at any Army Research Laboratory until certain conditions are met, including certification by the Secretary of the Army.  Additionally, some limitations on Department of Defense funding for animal research have applied only to specific appropriations statutes. For example, P.L. 103-139 §8043 (1993) and P.L. 104-61 §8032 (1995) restrict the use of funds appropriated by this Act for payments under a Department of Defense contract with the Louisiana State University Medical Center involving the use of cats for Brain Missile Wound Research.  Furthermore, P.L. 102-394 §213 (1992) stipulates that no funds appropriated under this Act or subsequent Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts shall be used by the National Institutes of Health or any other Federal agency, or recipient of Federal funds on any project that involves the capture or procurement of chimpanzees obtained from the wild. The term "recipient of Federal funds" includes private citizens, corporations, or other research institutions located outside the United States that are recipients of Federal funds. This provision was previously found in P.L. 101-166 §214 (1989), P.L. 101-517 §211 (1990), and P.L. 102-170 §213 (1991).
§ 45 mandates that any producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or seller of tuna products exported from or offered for sale in the United States must include "dolphin safe" or another term/symbol on the label if the product contains tuna harvested: - (A) On the high seas by a vessel engaged in driftnet fishing; - (B) Outside the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean using purse seine nets;  - (C) In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean using purse seine nets, provided the tuna meet the requirements for being considered dolphin safe under paragraph (2).  Violators can face civil penalties of up to $100,000. This statute acknowledges that driftnet fishing is a technique causing entanglement and death of marine resources in the North Pacific Ocean. It directs the Secretary of Commerce, through the Secretary of State, to negotiate with foreign governments for monitoring and evaluating methods to reduce lost or discarded driftnets.  Amendments under the Driftnet Act (1990), 16 U.S.C. § 1826, build on provisions from the 1987 Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act, making it illegal to fish for designated tuna species without a license or in violation of regulations set by the Secretary of Commerce within specified areas.  Additionally, this statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (or Commerce for marine mammals) to list endangered or threatened species and designate their critical habitats. It prohibits importing, exporting, taking, possessing, selling, or transporting any such species. Federal agencies are restricted from actions that may jeopardize these species' survival without an exemption. The act also requires recovery plans for endangered and threatened species.  These measures aim to protect marine life while ensuring transparency in the sourcing of tuna products sold in the U.S.
This statute also authorized the Secretary to promulgate regulations based on the findings of a report to ensure humane treatment of animals. It established the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) to review and evaluate new or revised test methods, facilitate interagency and international harmonization of toxicological test protocols, and encourage the reduction, refinement, or replacement of animal tests.  The ICCVAM was created by the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences under Section 463A(b) of the Public Health Services Act (NIEHS), 42 U.S.C. § 285l-1(b). The ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 required the NIEHS Director to designate it as a permanent interagency coordinating committee under the National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods.  The new act also stipulates that the ICCVAM should consist of heads (or their designees) from 15 federal agencies, along with additional agencies involved in developing or using animal tests and regulating them based on such tests.   This statute amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, and the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988, as detailed in this report. It also amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act, and the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950.  The statute further criminalizes actions such as willfully disturbing or killing birds, fish, or wild animals, taking their eggs or nests on federally protected lands; importing species that may be harmful to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or wildlife without a permit; and using aircraft or motor vehicles to hunt wild unbranded horses, mares, colts, or burros on public land. P.L. 110-161, § 109, 121 Stat. 2119 (2007), provides an exception to the last provision.
The Secretary of the Interior is permitted to use helicopters or motor vehicles on the Sheldon and Hart National Wildlife Refuge for capturing and transporting horses and burros, but such actions must adhere to humane procedures as prescribed by the Secretary. Amended in 1988, this statute also prohibits commerce involving fish, wildlife, or plants taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of treaties, federal or state laws, regulations, or Indian tribal laws. The Captive Wildlife Safety Act (P.L. 108-191, 2003) expanded coverage to include "prohibited wildlife species," defined as live lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars, or cougars and their hybrids, but exempts licensed zoos, circuses, research facilities, sanctuaries, humane societies, and animal shelters that meet specific criteria. This act was further amended by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-479) to assert U.S. sovereign rights over fish resources on the Continental Shelf, with certain exceptions for highly migratory species.  Additionally, a moratorium is imposed on taking and importing all marine mammals or their products, except for scientific research, public display, incidental commercial fishing activities, or in accordance with sound resource protection principles. Importation of pregnant, nursing, less than eight-month-old, or depleted species is prohibited unless approved by the Secretary. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972) also establishes a Marine Mammal Commission tasked with studying and recommending methods for marine mammal conservation.  Furthermore, an exception to the Marine Mammal Protection Act allows the Secretary of Defense to authorize the taking of up to 25 non-endangered or threatened marine mammals annually for national defense purposes.
Any such authorization must be made with the agreement of the Secretary of Commerce after consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission. As per section 10 U.S.C. § 7524.  In 1988, P.L. 100-711 added several provisions to the Act aimed at reducing the mortality of porpoises during the fishing for yellowfin tuna in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.  Congress enacted two new laws in 1992 to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972: P.L. 102-523 introduced the International Dolphin Conservation Act, which prohibited certain tuna harvesting practices; and P.L. 102-587, Title III, established the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program within the Department of Commerce to collect data on marine mammal health and coordinate responses to unusual mortality events.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-238) aimed to enhance the program for reducing incidental takings of marine mammals during commercial fishing operations. This statute amended 16 U.S.C. § 1374, authorizing the Secretary of Commerce to issue permits for importing polar bear parts taken in sport hunts in Canada and requiring a scientific review within two years.  Additionally, this act also amended 16 U.S.C. § 1374 to allow the Secretary of Commerce to issue permits for taking or importing marine mammals for public display only if the entity is registered or licensed under the Animal Welfare Act, shifting regulatory authority from the National Marine Fisheries Service to the Department of Agriculture.  In 1997, P.L. 105-42 amended various provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 as part of the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act.  In 2007, title IX of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-479) added the United States-Russia Polar Bear Conservation and Management Act to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, further modifying provisions related to preventing pollution from ships under 33 U.S.C.
This statute established the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund of the Treasury. The fund supports programs initiated by the Secretary of the Interior aimed at providing financial assistance for projects that promote the conservation of neotropical migratory birds.  Additionally, this statute aims to prevent the unintentional introduction and dispersal of nonindigenous species, such as the zebra mussel, into U.S. waters through ballast water management and other requirements. These nonindigenous species can disrupt the economy and the diversity and abundance of native fish if left unchecked.  The statute also authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to enforce the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean and the Convention between the United States of America and Canada for the preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. It implements the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention and a treaty between the United States and Canada, which aims to prevent overfishing and ensure optimum production while providing each party with benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters.  This statute repealed the Sockeye Salmon or Pink Salmon Fishing Act of 1947 (16 U.S.C. § 776-776f). It further authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to establish the United States catch level for Pacific whiting according to the standards and procedures outlined in the Agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada on Pacific Hake/Whiting, rather than under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), except as necessary for rebuilding other species.  Moreover, this statute aims to establish a partnership among the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, designated state agencies, and private organizations and individuals to carry out wildlife conservation and appreciation projects. It also amended the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize federal disaster assistance for household pets and service animals during major disasters or emergencies, and to require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop plans that consider the needs of pet owners before, during, and after such events.
This statute mandates that funds be allocated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to state and local authorities for animal emergency preparedness, encompassing activities such as procuring, constructing, leasing, or renovating emergency shelter facilities. It also stipulates that the FEMA Director must ensure that emergency preparedness operational plans account for the needs of individuals with household pets and service animals before, during, and after a major disaster.  Additionally, known as the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, this statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to collaborate with state fish and game departments on wildlife restoration projects aimed at selecting, restoring, rehabilitating, and improving areas suitable for feeding, resting, or breeding wildlife. It was later amended by the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000.  Section 404C of this statute directs the NIH Director to develop a research plan by October 1, 1993, focusing on methods that do not require animal use, reduce animal numbers, minimize pain and distress, and involve marine life other than marine mammals. Section 495 mandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the NIH Director, establish guidelines for research facilities regarding proper animal care and treatment, including the appropriate use of tranquilizers and analgesics. However, these guidelines cannot dictate specific research methodologies.  Institutions conducting biomedical or behavioral research with NIH funding must form animal care committees that review activities at least semi-annually and report to the NIH Director annually. If non-compliance is detected, the Director can provide an opportunity for corrective action; failure to comply may lead to suspension or revocation of grants or contracts.  Furthermore, this statute prohibits any intentional physical conduct on federal lands that significantly hinders a lawful hunt, subjecting violators to civil penalties not exceeding $10,000. The conference report clarifies that such actions must be both intentional and aimed at significantly hindering a lawful hunt. Violations may also be addressed through injunctive relief.  Examples of violations include using visual, auditory, olfactory, or physical stimuli to influence wildlife behavior.
This suggests that courts might interpret mere words directed at hunters as "physical conduct" if such words significantly impacted wildlife behavior (or a hunter's concentration), provided they do not violate the First Amendment by penalizing speech. The statute defines "conduct" to exclude speech protected by the First Amendment but implicitly acknowledges that such protection cannot be overridden.  Additionally, this statute established the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund to support projects for rhino and tiger conservation. Another statute authorized a cooperative program among federal, state, and tribal entities to promote economic stability in commercial fishing through coordinated research on salmon and steelhead resources.  Furthermore, it amended the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act by prohibiting the removal of shark fins and discarding their carcasses at sea, while also mandating discussions with other nations for shark finning prohibitions. The statute also authorized the Secretary of Defense to develop wildlife conservation programs on military reservations in collaboration with the Department of Interior and state agencies.  Moreover, this law implemented a treaty between Pacific Island states and the U.S., and included provisions from the Tariff Act of 1930 that prohibited importing certain wild mammals or birds if their home country restricted their "taking, killing, possession, or exportation" to the United States.
Animals may be confined for more than 28 hours when unavoidable causes prevent unloading and could not have been anticipated or avoided with care; and for up to 36 consecutive hours if the owner or person in charge requests it in writing, separate from a bill of lading or other rail form. The Twenty-Eight Hour Law is enforced by the Attorney General, who may bring a civil action for penalties between $100 and $500 per violation. Although the statute does not specify criminal penalties, its 1963 regulations under the act, still in effect (9 C.F.R. §§ 89.1-89.5), indicate that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) continues to play a role in enforcement.  In 2006, the USDA interpreted the law to include truck transportation of animals, noting it includes 'vehicles' such as trucks operating as express or common carriers. However, the agency stated its intention to maintain longstanding interpretation that the act does not apply to poultry.  This statute, part of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, prohibits taking polar bears in violation of an agreement between the U.S. and Russia, and restricts importing, exporting, possessing, transporting, selling, or exchanging any polar bear or its parts taken in violation of this agreement or other restrictions set by the commission established under it. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to enforce these provisions.  Enacted on April 5, 2000, this statute requires air carriers providing scheduled passenger service to report monthly any incidents involving animal loss, injury, or death to the Secretary of Transportation.
The Social Security benefit increase is automatically applied each year to reflect changes in the cost of living over a one-year period, based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), updated monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) is calculated as the growth in this index from the highest average CPI-W recorded during the third quarter of the previous year to the same period in the current year. If a COLA is triggered, it becomes effective in December and is paid in January of the following year. This mechanism was first implemented in 1975 through the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-603) and has been in effect since then.  On October 11, 2018, the Social Security Administration announced a 2.8% COLA for January 2019, based on BLS data from September 2018. The comparison of July-September CPI-W data from 2017 and 2016 facilitated this calculation.  Since 1975, there have been three years without a COLA: 2010, 2011, and 2016. According to the Social Security Act, a COLA is automatically paid if the current year's third-quarter average CPI-W exceeds that of any previous cost-of-living computation quarter. From 1975 to 2008, a new cost-of-living computation quarter was established annually, ensuring a COLA each year.  If the current year's third-quarter average CPI-W is equal to or lower than that of the prior cost-of-living computation quarter, no COLA is issued. For instance, in 2009, the third-quarter average CPI-W (211.001) was less than in 2008 (215.495), preventing a COLA for January 2010 and keeping the third quarter of 2008 as the benchmark until January 2011.
Despite the average Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) being higher in the third quarter of 2011 (223.233) than in 2010 (214.136), it was still lower than the third quarter of 2008 (234.242). Consequently, the third quarter of 2008 continued as the cost-of-living computation quarter until at least 2012, and no Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) was issued in January 2011. When the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2012 exceeded that of 2011, a COLA was triggered in 2013, and the third quarter of 2012 became the cost-of-living computation quarter. New quarters were designated as such in each year from 2012 to 2014 until the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2014 surpassed that of its preceding years. The average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2015 (233.278) did not exceed that of 2014, leading to no COLA in January 2016. Therefore, the cost-of-living computation quarter remained at the third quarter of 2014 when compared with the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2016. Refer to Table 2 for a recent history of the average CPI-W and its impact on the cost-of-living computation quarter and COLA triggers.  Social Security benefit amounts are not reduced if the CPI-W decreases between measuring periods. In years where no COLA is triggered, benefits remain unchanged (excluding Medicare Part B and D premiums). The absence of a COLA increase can affect certain Medicare Part B enrollees. For those whose Part B premiums are withheld from their Social Security benefits, the Social Security Act's hold-harmless provision ensures that net benefits will not decrease due to premium increases. Typically, this provision has minimal impact; however, in years with small or no COLA increases and significant Part B premium hikes, more individuals may be affected. For instance, a 0% COLA in 2016 followed by a 0.3% increase in 2017 resulted in approximately 70% of Medicare beneficiaries receiving reduced premiums to prevent a decline in their net Social Security benefits.
Due to the 2.0% Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) in 2018, the hold-harmless provision was less widely applicable that year, resulting in a decline to 28% of Medicare Part B enrollees being held harmless. The Medicare Trustees project that Medicare Part B premiums will increase by approximately $1.50 per month from $134.00 per month in 2018 to around $135.50 in 2019. Given a likely 2.8% Social Security COLA for 2019, the number of Medicare Part B enrollees held harmless is expected to further decrease. Generally, the dollar increase in enrollees' Social Security benefits—both those who were and were not held harmless in 2018—would exceed their 2019 Part B premium hikes. Consequently, many enrollees who were held harmless in 2018 are likely to pay the standard premium amount in 2019. Actual 2019 Medicare premiums will be announced later in 2018 and may differ from projections. COLAs also impact other programs; Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and railroad retirement "tier 1" benefits, equivalent to Social Security benefits, are increased by the same percentage as Social Security COLA or remain unchanged if no COLA is paid. Railroad retirement "tier 2" benefits, akin to private pensions, increase by an amount equal to 32.5% of the Social Security COLA (or not at all without a COLA). Veterans' pension benefits typically match Social Security COLAs but require annual legislation for this purpose. COLAs under the Civil Service Retirement System and federal military retirement systems use similar measuring periods and formulas, though FERS benefits increase by the Social Security COLA only if inflation is 2% or less. Certain Social Security elements, like the taxable earnings base, retirement earnings test exempt amounts, and SGA earnings level for the blind, are indexed to wages but adjust solely when a COLA is payable.
Federal employees hired before 1984 are part of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), which is no longer open to new entrants and will end with the death of the last CSRS annuitant, likely around 2075. New civilian federal employees since 1984 participate in the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) or have switched from CSRS during designated "open seasons" in 1987 and 1998. FERS began operation on January 1, 1987.  Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for CSRS annuities are calculated based on the average monthly percentage change in the CPI-W during the third quarter of the current calendar year compared to the same period in the previous year, with the base year being the one preceding the last COLA adjustment. For the December 2018 COLA (effective January 2019), the base year was 2017. Adjustments take effect on the first day of the month before they are paid.  Similarly, FERS COLAs are determined by comparing the percentage change in the CPI-W from one third quarter to the next. However, payments under FERS are limited based on beneficiary eligibility and inflation rates. Nondisabled FERS retirees do not receive COLAs until they reach 62 years of age. Survivors and disabled FERS retirees receive COLAs after one year of disability. If the inflation rate exceeds 2.0%, all COLAs paid under FERS are capped according to this formula.  The first law, P.L. 87-793 (1962), mandated automatic adjustments in civil service retirement and disability benefits when the CPI for the current year exceeded that of the base year by at least 3.0%. This was later amended in 1965 to require an adjustment whenever the CPI increased by 3.0% or more over three consecutive months.  P.L. 91-93 (1969) further adjusted COLAs, adding one additional percentage point to account for the erosion of benefits due to delayed adjustments, a change also applied to military retirees through P.L. 91-179.
The 94-440 law, enacted in October 1976, repealed the one percentage point addition to Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs). This legislation also introduced semiannual automatic adjustments of benefits based on the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from June to December (effective March following), and from December to June (effective September following).  P.L. 97-35, known as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, replaced these semiannual COLAs with annual adjustments based on the December-to-December change in the CPI, payable in March of the subsequent year.  Under P.L. 97-253, also referred to as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, COLA implementations were delayed by one month for fiscal years 1983, 1984, and 1985. The COLAs for these years began on April 1 for 1983, May 1 for 1984, and June 1 for 1985. This law also stipulated that nondisabled retirees under age 62 would receive 50% of the projected CPI plus the full difference between the actual CPI and these projections. The projected CPI was set at 6.6% for 1983, 7.2% for 1984, and again 6.6% for 1985. This provision was repealed by a supplemental appropriations law in August 1984, after which COLAs for January 1985 and beyond would be the full amount for all retirees.  P.L. 97-253 imposed certain limitations on COLAs, ensuring that annuities could not exceed the greater of maximum GS-15 federal employee pay or final employee pay (or high-3 average pay if higher), increased by the average annual percentage change in General Schedule rates from the retiree's annuity start date to the adjustment's effective date.  P.L. 98-270, enacted as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1983 in April 1984, delayed the scheduled COLA for May 1984 until December (payable in January 1985). Thereafter, all COLAs were to be effective in December and payable in January, based on the change in the average monthly CPI-W from third quarter to third quarter. This method mirrors that used by the Social Security program, as required by P.L. 98-21 (Social Security Amendments of 1983).  P.L. 98-369, known as the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, mandated that civilian and military retirement COLAs be paid in checks issued on the first business day following the effective month; COLAs effective in December were to be paid in January.  Finally, P.L. 99-177, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings), concluded these legislative changes.
Section 202 of the Social Security Act stipulates that benefits are provided through the month preceding a beneficiary's death, meaning no payments are made in the month of death itself. This policy has been part of the law since 1939 and does not apply to Medicare, which continues providing coverage until the date of death.  Social Security benefits are disbursed monthly; each recipient receives a payment for the previous month. For instance, a February check covers January's benefit period. This system is known as retrospective payment. If an individual dies late in the month, family members or the executor might fail to inform the Social Security Administration (SSA) promptly, leading to the need to return the check.  Legislators frequently receive requests to support legislation that would extend benefits into the month of death, either fully or partially. The ensuing section outlines common arguments for and against such changes.  Critics argue that withholding a full benefit in the final month of life does not make practical sense because expenses continue until the end of the month. They also highlight funeral and burial costs as additional financial burdens on beneficiaries' families or estates. Illustrations comparing someone who dies late in the month versus just after midnight the next day underscore the perceived unfairness, with the former receiving no benefit for that period while the latter gets full payment.  Critics contend that this policy is cruel, particularly affecting those already distressed by a loved one's passing. They find it incomprehensible why checks must be returned to the government in such cases. Those affected often question how a person had to live each day of their final month to receive benefits for that period and why family members are disadvantaged when a beneficiary dies at the end of the month, having incurred expenses throughout most of it.  Critics further argue that the public views this policy as an anomaly—a flaw in the Social Security system design. They believe it fails to reduce costs effectively, costing approximately $1.6 billion annually if benefits were paid for the entire death month. They maintain that such a policy undermines the integrity of the system by giving the impression of being arbitrary and bureaucratic.  Supporters counter that extending benefits into the final month would be expensive, with SSA estimating an annual cost of around $1.6 billion to pay full benefits in these cases.
Each house of the United States Congress, as authorized by the Constitution, has the power to discipline its own members for misconduct, with the Senate having exercised this authority through censures, restitution costs, and expulsion. The House and Senate use their rulemaking powers to impose legislative discipline, as explicitly provided in Article I, Section 5, clause 2: "Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member."  The rationale behind this disciplinary power is typically aimed at maintaining the integrity and dignity of the legislative process rather than solely punishing an individual. Such internal discipline complements any potential criminal or civil liability that may arise from misconduct.  Senators can be disciplined internally by their peers for actions deemed worthy of such action, based on the Senate's own standards. The Constitution's framers drew inspiration from British parliamentary practices and colonial legislative experiences to establish this principle, recognizing that while Congress members have minimal qualifications to ensure broad voter discretion, they retain the right to discipline those who violate their privileges or decorum.  Historically, Senate committees may recommend censure or expulsion resolutions, but such actions often do not result in full Senate action due to various reasons. The Select Committee on Ethics is delegated authority by the Senate to investigate improper conduct by senators and employees that reflect poorly on the Senate and can propose disciplinary measures independently, issuing letters of admonition.  Expulsion from Congress occurs when a two-thirds majority of the House or Senate votes to remove an elected member after they have taken their oath. This power is explicitly granted in Article I, Section 5, clause 2.
Justice Douglas highlighted the distinction in justiciability between an exclusion case based on qualifications other than those specified in another constitutional provision and an expulsion case stemming from misconduct, noting in his concurring opinion: "If this were an expulsion case, I would think that no justiciable controversy were presented." Although Congress's power to expel a member appears broad, with the Supreme Court suggesting it may be within the unbridled discretion of the charging body, policy considerations have generally constrained both the House and Senate from exercising their expulsion authority for misconduct occurring before an individual’s election or in a prior Congress when the electorate was aware but still reelected them. Occasionally, this restraint has been interpreted as evidence that "both Houses distrust their power to punish such cases." In distinguishing Powell's exclusion case from one involving expulsion, the Supreme Court noted in Powell v. McCormack that congressional precedents indicate the House typically does not expel a member for misconduct committed during an earlier Congress. However, it did not actually rule on the authority to expel for past misconduct. Justice Douglas concurred, stating: "If this were an expulsion case, I would think that no justiciable controversy were presented," in agreement with Senator Murdock's 1940 exclusion case argument that each house may expel anyone by a two-thirds vote.  The Supreme Court cited the case of Representative John W. Langley to support its assertion in Powell v. McCormack that the House "will not expel" for prior misconduct, although this primarily involved additional relevant considerations. The committee questioned whether the House could expel an individual for misconduct resulting in a criminal conviction before their election as a member, but also concluded the House could not permit membership from someone serving a sentence for a crime. Upon Langley's appeals being denied by the Supreme Court, he resigned his office. Many arguments opposing expulsion for prior Congress misconduct were based on the idea that the current House should not recognize injuries to a past House of Representatives.
The Senate has consistently viewed itself as a "continuing" body, meaning past actions that might have injured its integrity or dignity are not necessarily seen as violations against a distinct entity. In the McCarthy censure report, the Select Committee to Study Censure explicitly noted that precedents for expulsion or censure during a previous Congress can be found in Hinds (1275-1289). However, these precedents from the House cannot be applied because the House is not considered a continuing body.  A careful review of congressional precedents suggests that while there has been some debate about the Senate's right to expel a Member for past misconduct when reelected by their constituents who are aware of such conduct, this issue has often resulted in divided opinions. For instance, during the Credit Mobilier investigations in 1872, two House committees had conflicting views on disciplining Representatives Ames and Brooks. Despite these debates, the House adopted a censure resolution over expulsion to avoid questioning its authority.  In modern practice, and considering Supreme Court rulings, it appears that reluctance to expel a Member for past misconduct after reelection stems more from concerns about the wisdom of such policies rather than an explicit lack of constitutional power. The reticence in taking such actions reflects respect for the popular will and election choices of the people. Justice Story emphasized that while expulsion is necessary for gross misconduct, it should be used sparingly due to its potential infringement on individual rights. Similarly, Cushing argued that the power to expel a duly-elected Member without just cause would undermine the freedom of election.  In 1807, Senator John Quincy Adams discussed in a select committee report on expelling Senator John Smith for alleged involvement in the Aaron Burr conspiracy, the complexities surrounding the Senate's authority to act even when formal charges have been dropped.
The primary method for addressing ethical misconduct by Representatives (Senators were initially chosen by state legislatures rather than direct popular vote until 1913) was intended to be, and historically has been, dependent on voters ensuring their elected officials remained "virtuous" through frequent elections. However, the Constitution does not explicitly or implicitly limit this power of expulsion to conduct unknown to the electorate prior to election or reelection. No judicial rulings have imposed such a limitation, nor has there been any indication that one exists.  Historically, Senate expulsions (as well as House expulsions) have primarily addressed cases of perceived disloyalty to the United States Government or violations of criminal statutes involving misuse of official position. In 1995, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics recommended the expulsion of a member for conduct not subject to criminal prosecution but which involved allegations of unwanted sexual harassment, financial impropriety, and obstruction of an investigation.  The U.S. Senate has expelled 15 members: 14 during the Civil War period for disloyalty to the Union (one expulsion was later rescinded), and one in 1797 for other disloyal conduct. While relatively few Senators have faced expulsions, those facing such charges often choose resignation rather than risking an expulsion vote.  In the House of Representatives, five members have been expelled: three during the Civil War period for disloyalty, one in 1980 following conviction for bribery and conspiracy in office, and one in 2002 after convictions for bribery, receipt of illegal gratuities, and other corruption charges. Some faced potential expulsion and resigned their seats.  The Senate has demonstrated that it can investigate and adjudicate underlying factual circumstances involved in a member's criminal conviction related to official misconduct independently, even before all judicial appeals are exhausted. In the last such case, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics proceeded with the investigation after the member's conviction, issued a report recommending expulsion prior to the conclusion of appellate procedures, suggesting further consideration until the appeals process was complete.
Subsequent to the Member's conviction, the convicted Senator continued to participate and vote on the floor of the Senate until the full Senate considered the recommendation of expulsion by the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. It is worth noting that while precedents from both the Senate and House of Representatives provide valuable guidance in policy considerations and procedural decisions regarding disciplinary actions, such precedents are not binding but are given substantial weight.  The term "censure," unlike "expulsion," does not explicitly appear in the Constitution; however, its authority stems from Article I, Section 5, clause 2, which grants each house of Congress the power to "punish its Members for disorderly behavior." The Senate's Standing Orders state that the Select Committee on Ethics may recommend disciplinary actions against a Member, including censure, expulsion, or recommendations regarding seniority and positions of responsibility.  A "censure" in the Senate traditionally signifies formal disapproval by the full body through the adoption of a resolution expressing condemnation or disapproval by majority vote. However, no automatic forfeiture of rights or privileges follows such a censure; party and committee leadership roles are influenced by the political party's caucus rules.  While the term "censure" is often used in resolutions, formal actions can also include terms like "condemnation," "denouncement," or general disapproval without explicitly using "censure." In early cases, such as those of Senator Pickering (1811) and Senator Tappan (1844), the Senate's resolutions did not use specific terms but instead stated findings and conclusions. The 1844 censure discussion highlighted that the absence of an explicit term in earlier censures was intended to serve as a milder form of disapproval.  In more recent instances, such as Senators Bingham (1929) and McCarthy (1954), the Senate "condemned" them through resolutions. Meanwhile, other cases like Senators McLaurin (1902), Tillman (1902), Dodd (1967), Talmadge (1979), and Durenberger (1990) were explicitly "censured," while others were "denounced."
In 1954, the Senate Select Committee to Study Censure Charges outlined that if a senator engages in reprehensible conduct unrelated to their official duties but tarnishes the Senate’s reputation, the Senate retains the authority to censure such behavior. Similarly, the House of Representatives has broadly interpreted its power to discipline members through expulsion or censure. During the 63rd Congress, the House Judiciary Committee asserted that the House's power to punish for disorderly conduct is "full and plenary," allowing for summary proceedings, and is discretionary with no limitations except requiring a two-thirds vote for expulsion. The House Select Committee on Adam Clayton Powell defined censure as appropriate when there is a breach of the House's privileges, such as unparliamentary language, assaults, or offensive resolutions. Censure has also been applied to cases involving corrupt acts by members and non-cooperation with Senate committees.  The Constitution grants the House of Representatives discretionary power to punish disorderly behavior among its members for misconduct related to official duties, non-cooperation with committee work, or unofficial actions that might bring disrepute upon the House. The Senate's authority to censure under Article I, Section 5, clause 2, and its rules extends to conduct not necessarily violating specific statutes or written ethical guidelines but still deemed inappropriate by "acceptable norms," "good morals," and "senatorial ethics." Such behavior can also be judged as bringing the Senate into disrepute.  It is important to note that prior to 1968, there were no written Senate ethics rules. The drafting of a code of conduct in 1968 explicitly stated that this written code would not override existing unwritten standards or norms used to judge senators' conduct.
The 1964 resolution establishing and authorizing the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct (now known as the Select Committee on Ethics) was explicitly intended to continue the Senate's traditional authority and jurisdiction, including the power to investigate, make findings, and report to the full body on matters of official misconduct or violations of specific rules, codes, or statutes related to official duties. The Senate has censured members for various offenses, such as breaches of document secrecy, fighting in the Senate, allowing lobbyists with interests in legislation to be part of committees considering that legislation, non-cooperation with investigative committees, and financial irregularities involving contributions, expenses, and outside income.  There is no precedent for the full Senate to vote a resolution "reprimanding" a member for misconduct or for any committee to recommend such an action. In the censure case of Senator Thomas Dodd, Senator Tower proposed substituting "reprimand" for "censure" in the resolution, arguing that it would allow the Senate to express disapproval without the severity of censure. However, Senator Stennis, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, opposed using the term "reprimand," citing its lack of historical context in Senate procedure and suggesting that "censure" was more appropriate.  Stennis argued that "censure" had been consistently used for serious matters in legislative history. He noted that while the House of Representatives has required censured members to face public reprimands from the Speaker, this practice has never been implemented by the Senate. Stennis explained that "reprimand," as a term, lacked meaning and significance in legislative parlance and was too lenient compared to "censure."
It carries no significant weight. We thoroughly examined our research and concluded that it was comprehensive. Consequently, we rejected the mild legislative term "reprimand," which lacks substantial meaning or conveys only disapproval, in favor of "censure." This latter term, although still relatively mild with legislative implications, better reflects the Senate's position on the matter. In the case of Senators Tillman and McLaurin, who were censured by the full Senate in 1902 for fighting on the Senate floor, the Committee considered various options, including a reprimand deemed insufficiently severe. They recommended "censure," which was formalized through a resolution. The Committee explained that while the Senate could punish Senators by fines, imprisonment, suspension, or expulsion, a censure was appropriate given the nature of their contempt, as a reprimand would be too lenient.  Prior to the 1970s in the House, terms such as "reprimand" and "censure" were often used interchangeably. For instance, in 1921, a resolution instructed the Speaker to summon Representative Blanton of Texas and deliver both reprimand and censure. However, more recently, there has been a distinction: while a reprimand involves less disapproval than censure, it is still a significant rebuke. In the House, a reprimand resolution merely requires a vote, whereas a censure involves a formal reading in the well of the House.  In contrast, the Senate simply adopts a censure resolution without requiring a verbal rebuke from the Member. Therefore, a "reprimand" resolution in the Senate would functionally be equivalent to a censure and could technically be considered a form of censure, similar to recent denouncements in the Senate.
A resolution using the word "reprimand" in the Senate, though without historical precedent, might be publicly perceived as akin to the modern House practice—a minor rebuke—and could arguably be seen by the public as a lesser form of institutional disapproval or discipline compared to terms like "condemn," "censure," or "denounce." While not a disciplinary action employed by the full Senate, the Select Committee on Ethics can issue a reprimand or similar rebuke in a report or letter to a specific Senator without formal Senate approval. For instance, in 1991, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics issued such a reprimand against Senator Cranston concerning the "Keating Five" investigations, stating that his conduct "deserves the fullest, strongest and most severe sanction," and thus "does hereby strongly and severely reprimand" him. This reprimand was reported to the full Senate but no formal action was taken.  The current rules of the Senate Select Committee on Ethics allow for a "letter of admonition" after an initial inquiry if the Committee determines that a violation is inadvertent, technical, or minor in nature, and such a letter is not considered discipline.   In 1797, William Blount of Tennessee was found guilty by a select committee for writing a private letter seeking British assistance to seize Spanish Florida and Louisiana, leading to his recommended expulsion by the Senate.  During the Civil War, resolutions of expulsion were introduced in July 1861 against several Senators, including James M. Mason, Robert M. T. Hunter, Thomas L. Clingman, and others, who were accused of aiding a conspiracy against the Union and Government. These resolutions passed with overwhelming support by the Senate.  Similarly, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky was expelled in December 1861 for joining enemies of his country and fighting against the government he had sworn to support. Jesse D. Bright of Indiana faced similar charges but did not face expulsion.
On February 5, 1862, James Bright was charged with writing a letter in 1861 recommending an arms manufacturer to Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, which suggested disloyalty to the United States. The Judiciary Committee reviewed the expulsion resolution and recommended against it; however, after a lengthy debate, the full Senate voted to expel him by a margin of 32-14.  On January 10, 1862, Waldo P. Johnson from Missouri was referred to the Judiciary Committee for consideration. The committee found that his failure to take his seat at the start of the session and his inability to rebut allegations of disloyalty provided strong grounds against his loyalty to the Union. The Senate adopted the expulsion resolution by a vote of 35-0.  On January 10, 1862, Trusten Polk from Missouri was also referred to the Judiciary Committee. The committee reported that he had written in a secession newspaper supporting Missouri's joining "her Southern sisters," and had failed to present himself at the start of the session to refute implications of disloyalty. He was accused of going into enemy territory. The Senate adopted the expulsion resolution by a vote of 36-0.  On January 2, 1811, Thomas Pickering from Massachusetts delivered a speech on the Senate floor reading from a confidential letter from the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which he had received from the President. Although no written rule existed at the time concerning confidential communications, the resolution charged him with violating Senate rules by reading certain documents in session with open doors and disregarding the injunction of secrecy. After amendments were made, the resolution was agreed to by a vote of 20-7.  On May 10, 1844, Benjamin Tappan from Ohio delivered a document furnished under order of secrecy to an individual who provided it to the press. The Senate adopted a resolution stating that Tappan had committed a "flagrant violation" of its rules by disregarding its authority. The resolution was passed by a vote of 38-7.  On February 28, 1902, John L. McLaurin and Benjamin R. Tillman from South Carolina engaged in a physical altercation on the Senate floor after exchanging disparaging remarks. Tillman struck McLaurin, leading to an immediate fight that was only broken up by several people. A resolution adopted by a vote of 61-0 declared both Senators "in contempt" and referred the matter to the Committee on Privileges and Elections for further action.
On June 23, 1967, the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct investigated allegations involving Senator Tower related to unethical conduct with a private businessman in West Germany; conversion of campaign contributions for personal use; unauthorized use of loaned automobiles; and acceptance of reimbursements from both the Senate and private sources. The Committee recommended censure for the misuse of campaign funds and double reimbursements, even though no law or Senate rule explicitly prohibited such actions at the time. The Committee found that testimonial dinners were politically motivated, implying that Senator Tower should not have used their proceeds for personal benefit. These findings led to his censure by the Senate on November 17, 1967, where he was accused of using his senatorial influence for personal gain through political testimonials and campaign funds, actions deemed "contrary to accepted morals" and "derogatory to the public trust." The vote was 92-5.  On October 11, 1979, the Select Committee on Ethics investigated financial irregularities in Senator Talmadge's office, including excessive official reimbursements, inaccurate financial disclosures, late filing of campaign disclosures, and personal use of campaign funds. It was determined that he either knew or should have known about these improper acts, leading to his responsibility for them due to gross neglect of duty. The Committee recommended a "denouncement" as the appropriate resolution because it felt the situation differed from previous censures. On December 20, 1979, the Senate adopted S.Res. 249 by a vote of 81-15, formally denouncing Senator Talmadge’s conduct. Historians and parliamentarians categorize such actions as "censure," although using different terminology. This was followed by David F. Durenberger of Minnesota.
On July 25, 1990, the Senate Ethics Committee recommended to the full Senate that a Member be denounced and referred to their party conference for attention. The Member was also required to repay certain funds, as they had knowingly engaged in conduct violating statutes, rules, and Senate standards of ethical behavior. S.Rept. 101-382, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. (1990).  The Committee found that the Member employed a publishing arrangement to evade statutory limits on honoraria by directing fees from groups for which they made traditional appearances to a publisher, who then paid quarterly stipends ostensibly for book promotions, exceeding the statutory limit. Additionally, there was evidence of misuse of funds and abuse of office through concealment, specifically related to staying in a condominium that served as their personal residence. S.Rept. 101-382, supra at 11, 13-14.  Other findings included failure to disclose travel reimbursements from private parties, improper acceptance of gifts for travel from individuals with legislative interests, and conversion of campaign contributions for personal use.  The full Senate adopted the Committee's recommendation through S.Res. 311, 101st Congress, by a unanimous vote of 96-0. Historically, actions like this, known as "censure," are seen as formal disapprovals within the Senate and have been used for serious misconduct, such as disloyalty to the government or corruption.  Censure is the strongest statement of disapproval that can be issued by the Senate. Beyond censure, other measures might include financial restitution, limitations on privileges, or recommendations for a reduction in seniority status. However, there are no specific automatic penalties resulting from censure; the reputational damage and public rebuke may influence future elections.  In summary, on July 25, 1990, the Senate formally adopted a resolution disapproving of a Member's conduct, categorized as a "censure." This action is significant within the historical context of the Senate.
Since Haiti declared independence in 1804 following the slave rebellion led by Toussaint Louverture against French colonial masters, its politics have been marked by violence and authoritarianism. Between Louverture's rule ending in 1803 and François Duvalier’s dictatorial regime falling in 1986—during which both declared themselves president for life—numerous despotic rulers emerged. This legacy continues to pose challenges. Traditional centers of power, such as the military, religious institutions, business sectors, and the traditional elite, often perceive democratic reformist ideas as a threat due to Haiti's context.  The government apparatus remains predominantly staffed by Duvalierist appointees who have resisted change during post-Duvalier governments and are likely to continue doing so. Haitian history is characterized by conflicts between the mulatto elite and the majority black population. The vast majority of Haitians, being black, poor, and illiterate peasants, established their economic power by controlling the business sector. Mulattos held significant government positions during periods when they were politically dominant, emphasizing a European, Catholic tradition.  In contrast, black rulers generally highlighted Haiti’s African heritage through voodoo and other cultural practices. Race relations have improved in recent years; the Creole dialect, once disdained, is now an official language spoken by all Haitians, interracial marriages are common, and the government has become less dominated by mulattos. However, political events have recently heightened racial and class tensions, with black majorities accessing power primarily through public protests when tolerated and recent elections.  The mulatto elite wields most economic and political power in Haiti and generally resists dramatic changes that would redistribute wealth and privilege to the poor majority. Throughout much of this century, Haitian history was characterized by occupations or authoritarian regimes, such as when the United States intervened in 1915 to stop civil strife and prevent German influence. Over two thousand U.S. Marines were stationed until 1934, overseeing public works, tax collection, treasury management, and developing a native Haitian Constabulary. While some contributions were beneficial, the U.S. presence was widely resented as an affront to sovereignty.  By 1932, the U.S. withdrawal from Haiti began during Herbert Hoover's administration due to growing concerns about the occupation’s impact. A commission in 1930 found that while material improvements occurred, Haitians were excluded from positions of real authority. Under Franklin Roosevelt, a disengagement agreement was signed in August 1933, and the last U.S. Marines left Haiti in August 1934. Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier ruled for nearly 30 years until his death, leaving behind a legacy of repression and corruption.
Despite Duvalier's initial campaign promises of political freedom and social reform, he quickly consolidated power and became a dictator within a year. During his rule, arbitrary imprisonment, torture, and unexplained deaths were common occurrences. The Tontons Macoutes, Duvalier's private militia, conducted most of the repression. These "bogeymen" were loosely organized armed gangs recruited to eliminate opposition through violence and extortion, while also countering the army’s power by keeping it in check to prevent military coups. In 1964, Duvalier amended the constitution to become president-for-life, followed by another amendment in 1971 naming his 19-year-old son Jean-Claude as successor.  In the 1980s, "Baby Doc" Duvalier’s marriage to a prominent mulatto and their lavish lifestyle fueled resentment among the impoverished black majority. Fiscal corruption was rampant under Jean-Claude's government. As popular discontent grew, his regime became increasingly repressive. In response to mass demonstrations and international pressure, Jean-Claude fled Haiti for France on February 7, 1986. The U.S. supported his departure.  Following Duvalier’s ouster, Aristide was overthrown in 1991, marking the seventh government change since "Baby Doc" left. An interim National Council of Government (CNG) took power, disbanded the Tontons Macoutes, and drafted a new constitution, which was approved by over 99% of voters. The new constitution guaranteed personal liberties, distributed power among executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and transferred police to civil authority. It also established an independent electoral council for future elections.  However, Duvalierists, along with the military, obstructed the November 1987 elections through violence that killed dozens of voters, leading to the suspension of the election. In January 1988, the CNG held its own elections, which were widely seen as rigged in favor of Leslie Manigat. Yet, less than six months later, Manigat was overthrown by a military coup on June 20, 1988. Lt. General Henri Namphy seized power and ruled for 31 months, during which human rights violations increased.  Namphy was succeeded by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who promised democratic transition but continued to violate human rights according to U.S., human rights groups, and others' reports. Violent popular protests led to Avril's resignation after 18 months. In March 1990, a civilian government was appointed with the mandate to hold elections. Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the sole female Supreme Court justice, was selected as provisional president. A State Council was established to guide the executive branch.
The 220-year-old cathedral was destroyed by mobs as an apparent response to the Archbishop's homily, which warned of an impending "regime of authoritarian politics" and had strained relations with Aristide for years. Foreign diplomats criticized Aristide for his slow and insufficient condemnation of street violence. President Aristide faced severe social, economic, and political challenges in the Western Hemisphere. After eight months in office, he received mixed reviews; while credited with reducing crime in the capital, streamlining state enterprises, and bringing the military under civilian control, some observers questioned his commitment to democracy. Neither Aristide nor his Prime Minister belonged to a political party, leading other leaders to criticize him for failing to foster cooperation among democratic elements. Several legislators protested Aristide’s appointments of Supreme Court judges and ambassadors without Senate consultation, and he later agreed to consult the legislature but relations remained tense.  Aristide was also criticized for his approach to the judicial system. Jean-Jerome Lafontant, tried for his role in a failed January coup attempt, received a life sentence despite constitutional limitations on sentences to 15 years; Aristide declared July 4th a national holiday following Lafontant’s conviction. Observers noted that the trial was similar to those under the Duvaliers, lasting over 20 hours without key witnesses and with unqualified lawyers appointed.  Initially criticized for lacking a clear plan, in July 1991, Aristide presented an economic reform and investment plan to several nations and international lending institutions. Although they praised it and pledged $440 million in FY1992 aid, most of the funds were suspended due to the coup that overthrew his government on September 30, 1991.  Regarding human rights, Aristide faced criticism for appearing to condone mob violence while reducing overall violations during his tenure. Some observers believed he contributed to polarizing Haiti by not condemning violent retribution and threatening "pere lebrun," the practice of burning someone with a gasoline-soaked tire. After sentencing the former head of Tontons Macoutes, Aristide spoke of popular pressure as a deterrent, even threatening former members with "pere lebrun" in a September 27, 1991 speech.
It is elegant, attractive, splendorous, graceful, and dazzling. It also has a pleasant aroma that lingers wherever you go. The Constitution ensures its availability while banning macoutes from political life. During his exile, Aristide condemned the practice of necklacing. Observers argue that he also threatened the bourgeoisie for their insufficient support of his government. Some believe this speech contributed to his overthrow just days later, suggesting that members of the bourgeoisie financially backed the coup leaders.  In a report on the Aristide government's human rights record, Americas Watch and other groups noted that while it was unfortunate that Aristide’s speeches supporting Pere Lebrun overshadowed others advocating lawful redress for abuse, he had a duty to avoid statements that could be seen as endorsing Pere Lebrun. His failure to do so is considered a significant flaw in his human rights record.  The report also highlighted President Aristide's election with a two-thirds majority, emphasizing the international community’s recognition of him as Haiti's "sole legitimate head of state." Despite acknowledging the need for correcting human rights shortcomings, it asserted that such failings should not justify further violations by depriving Haitians of their right to self-government.  Human rights monitors credited Aristide's government with being the first to address the importance of improving respect for human rights and aiding the poor. They noted that despite progress during his tenure, this was reversed under the military regime that followed. Most sources praised Aristide for enhancing security in Haiti; he reduced common crime and removed rural "chefs deselections," or sheriffs, who had long ruled through extortion and violence.  According to State Department reports, there were no disappearances or political killings during Aristide's term but these increased significantly after the 1991 coup. The September 1991 coup occurred just four days after Aristide’s UN address, marking what he reportedly saw as the end of Haiti's dark past.  Regarding the military's role in democracy, under interim governments, the Haitian army often hindered democratic processes. However, following the departure of the last dictator in March 1990, some believed there had been a shift towards supporting democracy. The 7,000-man army demonstrated its capability to maintain order throughout the electoral process due to various factors including the loss of anti-democratic elements and pressure from both domestic and international forces.
Crime is typically proscribed, tried, and punished according to the laws of the jurisdiction where it occurs. However, American criminal law extends beyond the geographical boundaries of the United States under certain circumstances. State prosecution for misconduct abroad is mostly restricted to crimes that span multiple jurisdictions, such as those with elements occurring within the state and others outside its borders. Despite a significant number of federal criminal statutes having extraterritorial application, actual prosecutions remain relatively rare due to practical and legal complexities, including diplomatic considerations.  The Constitution does not prohibit either Congress or the states from enacting laws that apply beyond U.S. territory. It also does not prevent the federal government or individual states from prosecuting offenses committed overseas. Several constitutional passages imply this possibility: for example, it mentions "felonies on the high seas," "offences against the law of nations," and commerce with foreign nations.  Specifically, Congress is granted the power to define and punish "Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas" and "Offences against the Law of Nations," as well as the authority "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations." Additionally, the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact laws necessary for carrying out these powers. These powers have been used in the past to justify extraterritorial application, especially in maritime contexts.  Congress's commerce power includes regulating "Commerce with foreign Nations," which could encompass criminal statutes with extraterritorial reach. The other two Commerce Clause powers cover interstate and Indian commerce, but their scope is often described in broad terms by courts. Some recent cases have suggested that Congress has the authority to regulate illicit commercial activities abroad through U.S. citizens or entities.  These interpretations reflect a balance between constitutional principles and practical enforcement challenges, with courts sometimes choosing narrow interpretations of statutes to avoid broader determinations about congressional power under the Foreign Commerce Clause.
The Foreign Commerce Clause has been interpreted differently by various circuits. The Eleventh Circuit holds that Congress's foreign commerce power mirrors the "channels," "instrumentalities," and "substantive effect" components of its interstate commerce powers, while the Fourth Circuit expands this view to include any "activities that demonstrably affect U.S. foreign commerce." Historically, Congress has frequently exercised its extraterritorial authority through its shared or related enumerated powers, such as those involving foreign affairs and military activities. Nevertheless, the Constitution's enumeration of congressional powers includes specific and implicit limits on overseas enforcement, particularly under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Other limitations can be found in various provisions, including areas where state power intersects with federal authority in matters of foreign policy.  The primary limitation on extraterritorial jurisdiction lies in due process considerations, which have been inconsistently applied by American courts. While some courts note that due process sets boundaries for enacting and enforcing foreign laws, the Supreme Court has stated that such protections do not apply to aliens with no significant connection to the United States. However, there is a growing body of lower court decisions addressing these issues more directly.  In summary, while Congress can exercise its authority extraterritorially in certain circumstances, due process remains a critical constraint on this power.
Several courts articulate a due process requirement that necessitates a connection between the United States and the circumstances of an offense. At times, they utilize international law principles as a benchmark for assessing whether this connection exists. In other instances, they refer to the minimum contacts test for personal jurisdiction. The core principle in these cases is that due process demands that a defendant's conduct must have some past, present, or anticipated impact within the United States before being subject to criminal liability in an American court. While commentators have expressed reservations about this analysis, and certain courts have outright rejected it.  Another related due process challenge centers on notice, akin to concerns over secret laws and vague statutes, which is an exception to the defense of ignorance of the law. Factors such as knowledge, reason to know, obligation to know, or reasonable ignorance of legal requirements—often guided by international standards—appear most relevant. Citizens are expected to know their own country's laws; seafarers should be aware of maritime and their home nation's laws; everyone must be conscious of the laws in their location and the universal prohibitions against wrongdoing.  Applying an American criminal statute to an alien abroad, where such conduct is lawful under local law, could indicate a lack of sufficient notice and raise due process issues. While acknowledging this limitation, courts generally hold that questions of extraterritoriality are primarily within Congress's discretion; a decision to grant statutory provisions extraterritorial application, regardless of policy implications, does not in itself violate the Constitution.  As such, determining how far a statute applies beyond U.S. borders is typically seen as a matter of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation. Statutory construction principles have emerged, which can explain or predict case outcomes. One rule states that statutes silent on overseas application will be construed to apply only territorially unless there's clear evidence of broader intent. Moreover, "when a statute does provide for some extraterritorial application, the presumption against such application limits its scope to the terms specified."  In the past, another rule suggested that the nature and purpose of a statute might indicate Congressional intent to apply it beyond U.S. borders. Although this principle was first clearly articulated in United States v. Bowman , the Supreme Court's endorsement of domestic presumptions in Morrison cast doubt on Bowman 's continued relevance. Early indications showed reluctance among courts and commentators, but the decision in RJR Nabisco, another civil case, might have altered that stance.
In RJR Nabisco, the Court appeared to target Bowman indirectly without explicitly naming him. The uncertainty persists regarding whether the Court still considers Bowman's case as precedent. The final rule states that unless Congress's intent is clearly contrary, it is presumed that statutes are not intended to permit actions inconsistent with international law. Previously, cases suggested another presumption: if Congress did not explicitly state a statute should apply overseas and to both aliens and U.S. nationals, it would be assumed to apply only within the country. However, this view has become less compelling given the more generous interpretation of the grounds upon which claims can be staked based on international law. International law neither mandates nor strictly binds courts in deciding whether American laws should have extraterritorial application; rather, Congress and courts often consider international law when assessing policy implications of potentially internationally consequential legislation.  The extent to which a nation can exercise extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction is largely determined by national interests. The benefits or necessity for applying domestic law outside the country's borders must be weighed against potential impacts on other nations' interests. The Harvard Law School study from 1935 identified five primary principles: (1) territoriality, covering crimes that occur within a nation’s territory; (2) nationality, involving offenses committed by citizens abroad; (3) passivity, addressing acts targeting nationals abroad; (4) protection, relating to activities affecting national interests; and (5) universality, concerning crimes universally condemned. The American Law Institute's Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States offers a comprehensive modern interpretation of these principles, suggesting that reasonableness sets the limits on extraterritorial application. Courts generally assess international law's recognition of such applications by considering these principles expansively.  The territorial principle from the Harvard study extends beyond mere geographical borders to include conduct on a nation’s waters and vessels, as well as acts with effects within the country's territory, regardless of where they are committed.
Congress frequently specifies in statutes that certain provisions apply within its territorial waters and on its vessels, even though such territory is rarely mentioned explicitly. Courts have traditionally recognized an "impact" basis for extraterritorial application when case facts suggest additional principles of international law beyond mere territoriality. If the territorial principle extends beyond what its caption suggests, the protective principle typically does not. It encompasses crimes committed outside a nation's territory that threaten its security, territorial integrity, or political independence. However, courts interpret this principle to permit the extraterritorial application of statutes protecting federal interests and functions, such as overseas murders or attempted murders of federal officials, acts of terrorism aimed at influencing U.S. foreign policy, threats to national security, false statements or forgery undermining immigration law enforcement, unauthorized entry into the U.S., and bribery involving federal contracts.  The nationality principle grounds extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction on the accused's citizenship, as exemplified by the Supreme Court case Blackmer v. United States, which involved an American living in Paris who defied a federal court subpoena. Cases invoking this principle often involve other principles too. The passive personality principle grants jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victim; it is most commonly invoked when there are indications of additional legal principles at play.  The universal principle allows any nation to punish offenses against all nations where the offender is found, particularly piracy and crimes committed on the high seas by stateless vessels.  Congress's explicit declaration that a statute applies outside U.S. territory serves as clear evidence of intent to create extraterritorial jurisdiction. It has most often done so through provisions outlawing misconduct occurring "within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States," a concept dating back to the First Congress, which now includes navigable waters, federal enclaves within the U.S., and areas beyond its territorial confines. This jurisdiction has been statutorily expanded over time to cover various criminal laws related to air travel, customs matters, and other federal functions.
The范畴涵盖在飞行中的航天器；无国籍的潜水艇船只在公海上的行为；海外的联邦设施和联邦雇员的海外住所；驻外美军及其随行人员；以及美国政府雇员、军事人员或其随行人员在海外从事的人口贩卖和性犯罪。国际条约、公约或其他协议赋予了另一类具有明确域外适用性的联邦刑事法的主题，这些条约由美国参与。这类条约下的联邦罪行范围不一。有些仅在美国国民实施犯罪时才具有域外效力；有些则因行为本身在任何司法管辖下均被视为严重不当而被涵盖在联邦管辖范围内，只要犯罪人逃离至或被抓捕后返回美国接受审判，或在其他情况下“发现”于美国境内；还有一些则在多种其他明确的属地情况下也享有域外效力。另一类具有明确域外适用性的联邦刑事法条款要么含糊地声明其规定适用于国外，要么详细描述了其规定的域外适用条件，这些条件通常涉及与美国外国商业相关的因素。《海上缉毒法》（MDLEA）较为独特，因为它授权基于国家的同意而将联邦刑法扩展至域外，并不仅限于船舶是否属于美国司法管辖范围。MDLEA禁止在受美国法律管辖的船只上制造、分销或意图制造或分销毒品的行为。其定义涵盖了不仅包括普通美国内水法的管辖范围，还囊括了其他国家的海域管辖权，只要这些国家同意美国法律适用于该船。此外，“无国籍”船舶也被涵盖在内，即那些没有被任何国家有效登记的船只。MDLEA为海岸警卫队在加勒比海和中美及南美洲沿海地区的缉毒行动提供了法律依据，并且法院认为其是国会行使宪法授权定义并惩罚公海上犯罪以及违背国际法的行为的有效手段。不过，关于是否必须证明美国与犯罪之间的关联性，以及赋予法官而非陪审团决定管辖权的条款的应用问题上，法院意见不一。在Mor rison和RJR Nabisco之前，低级法院普遍认为Bowman和Ford表明了大量其他联邦罪行实际上通过国会隐含意图的作用在海外实施。事实上，他们解释称Bowman和Ford暗示美国域外刑事管辖权包括旨在保护联邦官员、雇员及其财产的广泛法规；防止走私活动；以及打击对联邦部门和机构海外活动的妨碍或腐败行为。
They argued that statutes prohibiting the assassination of Members of Congress can be applied against Americans for murders committed abroad, and that laws banning the murder or kidnapping of federal law enforcement officials are enforceable in foreign countries, regardless of the offenders' nationality or their mistaken beliefs about the victims' status. Additionally, they considered it appropriate to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over cases involving (1) attempts by aliens to defraud the United States for admission; (2) false statements made by Americans overseas; (3) theft of federal property abroad; (4) counterfeiting or misusing federal documents or checks in foreign jurisdictions, regardless of the offenders' nationality; and (5) murder of a foreign national intended to facilitate U.S. criminal operations. RJR Nabisco casts significant doubt on these assessments, particularly when there is no clear indication that Congress intended such statutes to apply abroad. The same skepticism applies to earlier judicial interpretations. It was logical to conclude that statutes designed to prevent the theft of federal property should be applicable worldwide. There seemed little reason to treat statutes protecting U.S. property from intentional destruction differently from those addressing theft.  In RJR Nabisco, however, the Court did affirm implied extraterritoriality for "piggyback" statutes such as conspiracy and aiding and abetting, which necessarily depend on an underlying crime. Earlier cases suggested that conspirators to violate U.S. laws, even if they never entered the country, could still be guilty of conspiracy. The same rationale applied to accessories to overseas federal crimes and piggyback offenses predicated on crimes with extraterritorial reach.  State criminal laws are less likely than federal laws to apply overseas, given that state statutes were generally not enacted with an eye toward foreign application, and their territorial limitations could frustrate legislative purposes. The Constitution suggests that the federal government is responsible for protecting American interests abroad, although courts and commentators have recognized a limited ability of states to legislate conduct outside U.S. borders. Congress can preempt state authority in areas where it has plenary power.
The Supremacy Clause renders treaties binding upon states, thereby placing them beyond legislative reach. Without federal legislative action, state extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction is determined by the intent to legislate rather than the power to do so. States typically assert such jurisdiction only in limited circumstances where there is a clear connection to the state. Common provisions include cases where elements of an offense are committed within the state's borders or elsewhere, or situations involving attempts or conspiracies to commit crimes across boundaries. Other definitions extend extraterritorial jurisdiction to instances like victims dying within the state after being fatally wounded outside it, property stolen from another location entering the state, or conduct outside the state constituting a failure to comply with state law.  Despite numerous federal statutes potentially having extraterritorial reach, few prosecutions have occurred due to legal, practical, and diplomatic challenges. These include difficulties in navigating international consent for investigations and potential criminal prosecution of foreign investigators. Investigations into extraterritorial federal crimes without host country consent are exceptionally rare.  Congress has supported efforts to enhance multinational cooperative law enforcement through mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs). The United States currently operates over 70 MLATs, facilitating document collection and delivery, locating individuals, executing search warrants, taking witness depositions, persuading foreign nationals to come voluntarily for evidence, and seizures related to forfeiture.  Witness depositions can be obtained in a foreign country through letters rogatory.
Letters rogatory involve formal requests from one country's courts to another for testimonial evidence. Governed by statute and rule, these procedures are often a last resort due to their time-consuming and cumbersome nature, as they must be conducted through diplomatic channels and may depend on the discretion of the foreign court involved. Historically, American law enforcement has used less formal cooperative methods abroad to investigate extraterritorial offenses. In recent decades, steps have been taken to facilitate such cooperation. This includes the deployment of increasing numbers of personnel from federal civilian law enforcement agencies overseas. For instance, the Justice Department’s Criminal Division maintains resident legal advisors in 45 countries; the FBI operates legal attache offices in 78 foreign cities; the DEA has offices in 92 cities; the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency operates out of 75 locations; and the Secret Service has 20 such offices. Some regulatory agencies with law enforcement responsibilities have working arrangements with their foreign counterparts, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is a signatory to the International Organization of Securities Commissions' multilateral memorandum of understanding (IOSCO MMOU) for cooperation and information exchange.  Congress has enacted measures like the Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act of 2009, authorizing Justice Department attorneys to petition federal judges for orders facilitating investigations by foreign law enforcement authorities. These include search warrants; court orders for access to stored electronic communications and records; pen register or trap and trace orders; and subpoena authority for testimonial and document production.  Searches and seizures conducted abroad can have Fourth Amendment implications, particularly concerning U.S. citizens or those with significant connections to the United States. The Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez clarified that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to foreign nationals' property outside the U.S., unless they have "previous significant voluntary connections" with the country. The application of the Fourth Amendment to U.S. citizens or foreign nationals with substantial ties to the U.S. is less clear, and prior to Verdugo-Urquidez, neither the amendment nor its exclusionary rule were considered applicable to overseas searches and seizures by foreign authorities, except in cases where such conduct "shocked the conscience of the court" or when U.S. law enforcement was deeply involved, constituting a joint venture or equivalent participation.
Since the ruling in Verdugo-Urquidez, courts have generally held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches or seizures of U.S. citizens conducted by foreign officials outside the United States. However, these courts have acknowledged rare exceptions based on "joint venture" and "shocked conscience." Prior to Verdugo-Urquidez, lower federal appellate courts seemed to agree that the Fourth Amendment governed searches and seizures by U.S. law enforcement officials of U.S. citizens abroad. Since then, the central question has shifted from whether the Fourth Amendment applies to what it requires.  Typically, a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate upon probable cause is necessary for a reasonable search or seizure in the United States. In Verdugo-Urquidez and subsequent cases, two concurring opinions suggest that this warrant requirement may not apply to searches conducted by U.S. officials abroad, unless local laws authorize it through the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or other means. Nonetheless, "the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard applies to United States officials conducting a search affecting a U.S. citizen in a foreign country." Such searches are reasonable if they conform to foreign law and can be upheld under the good faith exception when U.S. officials reasonably rely on foreign representations.  Similarly, the Fifth Amendment’s self-incrimination clause and Miranda warning requirements do not apply to statements made abroad by U.S. citizens to foreign officials, subject to the "joint venture" and "shocked conscience" exceptions. However, these protections do apply to custodial interrogations conducted abroad by American officials, regardless of the defendant's nationality.   Confessions or other incriminating statements must generally be freely given to be admissible at trial in the United States. Federal crimes are typically subject to a five-year statute of limitations, but certain offenses like federal capital crimes, sex offenses, and violent terrorist activities can be prosecuted at any time. Nonviolent terrorism offenses have an eight-year statute of limitations. The statute of limitations is suspended or tolled during fugitive periods. Section 3292 authorizes the suspension of the statute of limitations to await evidence requested from a foreign government: Upon application by the United States, filed before indictment, indicating that evidence of an offense is in a foreign country and that an official request has been made for such evidence, the district court can suspend the running of the statute of limitations if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that such evidence reasonably appeared to be, or was, in the foreign country.
Section 3292 suspensions can last up to six months if foreign assistance is provided before the statute of limitations expires, or up to three years otherwise. The period starts when a request for foreign assistance is filed and ends with the final action by the foreign government. The government must demonstrate, by a preponderance of evidence, that the purpose of the request is to obtain overseas evidence. Despite these time constraints, the government does not need to prove that it acted diligently in gathering this evidence.  There is disagreement among circuits regarding whether Section 3292 can be used to revive a statute of limitations after it has expired or to extend the period for evidence already obtained at the time of filing the request. At least one circuit interprets "the district court before which a grand jury is impaneled to investigate the offense" as identifying the court that may issue suspension orders, without limiting the statute to pending grand jury investigations.  Extradition, one of the oldest forms of international law enforcement assistance, involves treaties where one country surrenders a fugitive to another for prosecution or serving a sentence. The United States has bilateral extradition treaties with about two-thirds of the world's nations. Pre-1960 treaties reflect the common law view that criminal jurisdiction is territorial, meaning extradition was not possible for crimes committed outside national borders. Post-1960 agreements either require extradition regardless of where the offense occurred or allow it if laws are compatible.  More recent treaties address traditional complications like the nationality exception, political offenses, and limitations to specific designated offenses. Federal crimes committed abroad are typically the work of locals, but treaty provisions commonly exempt each party from extraditing its own citizens or subjects. Recent treaties either explicitly permit extradition regardless of citizenship or require referral for prosecution if extradition is refused on such grounds.  The "political offense exception," now a standard in nearly all international extradition treaties, originally protected insurgents and is often interpreted to include political offenses like treason, sedition, and related acts committed during uprisings.
In addressing whether trial witnesses could testify remotely via video conferencing, Craig concluded that the Confrontation Clause's mandate for physical face-to-face confrontation can be waived under specific circumstances, considering public policy and exigent needs of the case. Roberts examined if admitting hearsay evidence violated the Confrontation Clause, concluding that such admission is permissible as long as it falls within a "firmly rooted" exception. However, Crawford v. Washington later determined that testimonial hearsay must be excluded unless cross-examination is conducted, thereby invalidating the Roberts' blanket exception for all hearsay. Crawford explicitly rejects any compromise on actual confrontation in cases involving testimonial hearsay, whether through depositions or other forms.  Craig's video and public interest exceptions remain ambiguous. While one appellate court found that critical evidence alone does not suffice to justify a Craig exception, another held that national security interests might qualify. Pre-Crawford cases required an effort to secure the defendant's attendance at overseas depositions, suggesting Crawford might not necessitate significant changes in this area. The Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of Craig implied it viewed overseas depositions as more compatible with the Confrontation Clause than video testimonies.  In a subsequent case, the Fourth Circuit upheld the admissibility of testimony when both conditions for a Craig exception were met: denial of face-to-face confrontation due to important policy considerations and assurance of reliability through an "oath, cross-examination, and observation of the witness's demeanor." The Federal Rules of Evidence govern federal criminal trials, allowing depositions taken overseas that meet Rule 15 scrutiny.   The primary hurdle is Rule 802, which favors adversarial testing of evidence but includes a specific exception for depositions, including those from abroad under Rule 15. When witnesses are located internationally, the government's need for secrecy may conflict with the defendant's rights, as encapsulated in Rule 16’s requirement for disclosure of statements in the government’s possession.
The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in their favor, but the inclusion of a terrorist suspect who is also a federal custody witness could undermine the value of that witness as an intelligence source. Despite this, the amendment also ensures the defendant’s right to confront any witnesses against them, including those providing classified information. To address these conflicting interests, Congress has enacted the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), which allows courts to approve prosecution-prepared summaries of classified information for disclosure and evidence introduction instead of the original documents. These summaries must adequately replace the classified information, ensuring that the defendant's right to a fair trial is not compromised by the government’s national security concerns.  Additionally, there is a statutory procedure designed to facilitate the admission of foreign business records in federal courts. This section covers "foreign records of regularly conducted activities" in any form, including memoranda, reports, and data compilations from foreign countries. It exempts these qualified business records from the hearsay rule in criminal proceedings and permits their authentication through foreign certification. The process also includes a mechanism to challenge document reliability as part of pre-trial motions.  Early appellate decisions upheld Section 3505 against Confrontation Clause challenges, such as depositions supported by Ohio v. Roberts. However, the Crawford case cast doubt on the applicability of the all-encompassing Roberts rule when it held that only direct confrontation is sufficient for testimonial hearsay. While Crawford did not provide a comprehensive definition of testimonial hearsay, it noted that many hearsay exceptions cover statements that are not inherently testimonial, such as business records.  The Constitution grants Congress extensive authority to enact extraterritorial laws with few limitations on their exercise. Similarly, states have residual powers and have enacted criminal laws applicable beyond U.S. territorial boundaries. Despite this, extraterritorial prosecutions remain rare due to practical, legal, and diplomatic challenges. Examples of such statutes include 8 U.S.C. § 1375a(d)(3) (involving international marriage brokers), 15 U.S.C. §§ 1175 and 1243-45 (regarding gambling devices and weapons), 16 U.S.C. § 3372(a)(3) (possession of illegally taken wildlife or fish), and 18 U.S.C. §§ 81, 113, and 114 (covering arson, assault, and maiming).
18 U.S.C. § 115 pertains to violence against federal officials, former officials, and their families. Sections 117 and 118 address domestic assault by habitual offenders and interference with protective functions respectively. Section 249 covers hate crimes, while Section 546 deals with smuggling goods into a foreign country from an American vessel. Theft is governed by Section 661, and receiving stolen property is addressed in Section 662. Sections 831 and 931 deal with threats, theft, or unlawful possession of nuclear material and the purchase, ownership, or possession of body armor by violent felons, respectively.  Sections 1025 and 1081-1083 pertain to false pretenses and gambling ships. Sections 1111, 1112, and 1113 cover murder, manslaughter, and attempted murder or manslaughter. Section 1115 addresses misconduct or neglect by ship officers. Kidnapping is regulated by Section 1201, malicious mischief by Section 1363, sale or possession with intent to sell obscene material by Section 1460, and obscene visual representations of sexual abuse of children by Section 1466A.  Sections 1587 and 1591 deal with the captain of a slave vessel with slaves aboard and sex trafficking of children. Sections 1656-1659 cover piratical conversion of vessels, plundering a ship in distress, and attack upon a vessel with intent to plunder. Section 1654 prohibits Americans from arming or serving on privateers outside the United States.  Video voyeurism is addressed by Section 1801, while prohibited monetary transactions are governed by Section 1957. Sections 2111-2199 deal with various crimes against seamen and ship officers, including robbery, cruelty to seamen, inciting revolt or mutiny, and abandoning sailors overseas.  Sections 2241-2252A address sexual abuse of minors or wards, sale or possession of material involving the sexual exploitation of children, and child pornography. Sections 2261 and 2261A pertain to interstate domestic violence and stalking. Destruction of ships is covered by Sections 2271-2279.  Sections 2283 and 2284 deal with transportation of explosives or other dangerous materials for terrorist purposes on the high seas, while Section 2285 covers terrorism transcending national boundaries. War-time activities affecting armed forces are governed by Section 2388. Sections 2422(b) and 2425 address causing minors to engage in prostitution or transmitting information about a minor.  Section 2318 pertains to transporting counterfeit phonorecord labels, copies of computer programs or documentation, and copies of motion pictures or other audio-visual works.

Section 175 of Title 18 of the United States Code pertains to offenses involving biological weapons, including their development, production, stockpiling, transfer, acquisition, retention, possession, and misuse, as well as assisting a foreign power in such activities. The U.S. federal government has extraterritorial jurisdiction over such offenses if committed by or against a U.S. national.  Section 229 of Title 18 addresses threats to use chemical weapons, with similar jurisdictional factors involving the status of victims or offenders as U.S. nationals, offenses against federal property, or threats directed at the United States.  Section 831 of Title 18 concerns threats to use nuclear materials for injury or destruction, and includes jurisdiction if committed within special aircraft or maritime and territorial jurisdictions of the United States, involving U.S. nationals, American legal entities, or intended to compel action or abstention by the U.S.  Sections 875, 877, and 878 address threats communicated in foreign commerce, mailing threats from a foreign country to the U.S., and threatening to kill, kidnap, or assault internationally protected persons, respectively. Jurisdiction is established if victims or offenders are U.S. nationals, offenses involve transfers to or from the United States, or are directed against the U.S.  Section 1203 of Title 18 covers threats to kill or injure hostages outside the U.S., with jurisdiction if committed by a U.S. national, involves a U.S. national as the victim, or is intended to compel action or abstention by the U.S.  Sections 1512 and 1513 pertain to threatening federal witnesses or informants. Extraterritorial federal jurisdiction applies in these cases.  Section 2280 of Title 18 involves threats against maritime navigation, while Section 2281 pertains to threats against fixed maritime platforms. Both have similar jurisdictional factors involving U.S. nationals as victims or offenders and intended to compel action or abstention by the U.S.  Sections 2290, 2291, and 2332a of Title 18 address destruction of vessels or maritime facilities, attempts or conspiracies to do so, and threats to use weapons of mass destruction. Jurisdiction is established if offenses involve U.S. nationals as victims or offenders or are committed against federal property.  Section 2290 also covers the destruction of vessels or maritime facilities by U.S. nationals, with additional jurisdiction if a U.S. national is aboard the victim vessel or if the victim vessel is a U.S. vessel.
This paragraph does not apply to offenses committed by a person described in section 3261(a) of this title.

Nothing in this chapter deprives a court-martial, military commission, provost court, or other military tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or offenses that by statute or law of war may be tried by such tribunals.  No prosecution may commence against a member of the Armed Forces subject to chapter 47 of title 10 (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) under this section unless: (a) the member ceases to be subject to such chapter; or (b) an indictment or information charges that the member committed the offense with one or more other defendants, at least one of whom is not subject to such chapter.  (2) Anyone who, while employed by or accompanying the Federal Government outside the United States, engages in conduct outside the United States that would constitute an offense under chapter 77 or 117 of this title if it occurred within the United States or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States—shall be punished as provided for that offense.  No prosecution may commence under this section if a foreign government, in accordance with jurisdiction recognized by the United States, has prosecuted or is prosecuting such person for the conduct constituting such offense, except upon approval by the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General (or a person acting in either capacity), which function of approval may not be delegated.

Since the establishment of the modern U.S. intelligence community following World War II, Congress and the executive branch have rarely disclosed the total extent of intelligence expenditures, with this transparency being limited to only two fiscal years in the 1990s. Intelligence programs and personnel were mostly contained within the Department of Defense (DOD) budget, though not always identified specifically. This practice has long been criticized by advocates of open government. In the mid-1970s, efforts aimed at increasing Congress's oversight over the intelligence community included proposals to publicly disclose intelligence spending amounts. Following the end of the Cold War, many observers argued that the need for secrecy regarding total intelligence spending had diminished, as few foreign entities could exploit such information, and terrorist organizations lacked the capability to utilize comprehensive data on intelligence budgets.  In recent years, there has been renewed consideration of making public the overall totals of intelligence spending. Legislation in 1991 and 1992 indicated that "the sense of Congress" was that aggregate intelligence and related activity funding should be disclosed publicly. However, both the House and Senate subsequently declined to mandate the release of such data. During the Clinton Administration, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet twice initiated the disclosure of total figures for intelligence and intelligence-related activities; although these were released for fiscal years 1997 and 1998, no subsequent levels have been made public.  The issue has persisted, with the 9/11 Commission recommending that overall appropriation amounts for national intelligence be disclosed. In its final report, it suggested that Congress should pass a separate appropriations act specifically for intelligence to justify broad allocations among various intelligence activities. Several Intelligence Reform proposals in 2004 included provisions for making budgets public, but ultimately, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) did not include such provisions.  More recently, the FY2007 Intelligence Authorization legislation (S. 372), reported in January 2007, required publication of budget totals for national intelligence programs but not tactical ones.  This report outlines the components of the intelligence budget, past practices concerning authorizations and appropriations, arguments both for and against public disclosure of spending totals, a legal analysis of these issues, and an examination of post-Cold War developments' implications. It also reviews historical congressional interest in maintaining secrecy around intelligence expenditures, noting that the term "intelligence budget" is not easily defined.
