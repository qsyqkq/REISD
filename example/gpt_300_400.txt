Section 202 of the Social Security Act dictates that benefits are paid for the month preceding the one in which a beneficiary passes away, meaning no payments are made for the deceased's final month. This rule has been part of the legislation since 1939 and does not apply to Medicare, which covers expenses until the date of death. Benefits are issued on a monthly basis; each check (or direct deposit) represents the previous month’s payment—e.g., a February check covers January. This is known as a retrospective payment system.  If a beneficiary dies late in the month, family members or the executor may not inform the Social Security Administration (SSA) promptly to halt the payment, leading to the returned check requirement. Congress frequently receives requests to enact legislation that would provide benefits for the deceased’s final month, either fully or partially. The ensuing section outlines common arguments supporting and opposing such payments.  Critics of the current policy argue it is illogical to withhold a benefit that could help cover funeral and burial costs. They contend that a person's financial obligations do not cease at death, and that family members often need funds immediately afterward. Comparisons are frequently drawn between those who die on the last day of the month and receive no benefits versus those who pass away early in the next month and receive full payments for their preceding month. Critics find this policy unjust as it can exacerbate grief and financial distress for families already facing loss. They believe that having to return a check is particularly bewildering, underscoring the policy's unfairness.
Individuals affected by this policy often ask questions such as: Does it mean that my father (or mother) had to live through each day of their final month to receive benefits for that entire month? Why are family members placed at a disadvantage if a beneficiary dies shortly after incurring significant living expenses during most of the month? Critics argue that the public views this policy as an anomaly—a mistake in the design of the Social Security system. They suggest that such a policy could be costly, seeing it as a "poor" way to reduce the system's expenses. These critics contend that the policy discredits the system by giving the impression of arbitrariness and unyielding bureaucracy. They maintain that benefits should at least cover the part of the month during which the beneficiary was alive.  Supporters of the current policy argue that paying full benefits for a death in any given month would be prohibitively expensive, with the Social Security Administration (SSA) estimating an annual cost of $1.6 billion. An alternative is to pay 50% of the benefit if the beneficiary dies in the first half of the month and a full benefit if they die in the second half, which would cost about $1.2 billion annually. Alternatively, pro-rating benefits based on the number of days the beneficiary was alive during the final month would cost around $800 million annually.  The SSA also estimated that under a proposal to pay a full benefit for the month of death to a surviving spouse (who need not have been living with or entitled to benefits from the deceased), or pro-rated benefits based on the number of days the beneficiary was alive, the additional annual cost would be significant.
Each house of the United States Congress is constitutionally empowered to "punish" its Members for misconduct, with the Senate having exercised this authority through measures such as formal censures, imposition of restitution costs, and expulsion. Both the House and the Senate enforce legislative discipline using their rulemaking powers, as explicitly stated in Article I, Section 5, clause 2: "Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member." The primary purpose of this discipline is to safeguard the integrity and dignity of the legislative process rather than solely as punishment. Internal congressional discipline applies to any conduct deemed deserving by the Senate, which operates independently from potential criminal or civil liabilities.  The constitutional authority for such discipline was influenced by British parliamentary practices and colonial legislative experiences, reflecting a principle that while Congress members' qualifications are minimal to allow broad voter discretion, both houses retain the right to discipline Members who violate their privileges, decorum, or damage their integrity.   Historically, Senate committees have recommended various disciplines, including censure or expulsion, but the full Senate has sometimes taken no action, adjourned before consideration (resulting in a subsequent election defeat for the Member), allowed resignations, or failed to act on specific recommendations.
An exclusion in Congress occurs when the Senate (or the House) refuses to seat a Member-elect based on objections from another Member or Member-elect. This rejection typically requires a simple majority vote due to the individual not meeting the three constitutional qualifications for office—age, citizenship, and residence within the state from which they were elected—or because they were "not duly elected." While there have been past minority arguments against this practice, it is now widely accepted that the Senate’s authority to exclude a Member-elect by a simple majority is limited to verifying whether the individual meets constitutional qualifications or was “duly elected,” with such disputes often resolved in contested election cases. The Supreme Court's decision in Powell v. McCormack clearly stated that "the Constitution leaves the House [and the Senate] without authority to exclude any person, duly elected by his constituents, who meets all the requirements for membership expressly prescribed in the Constitution."  Precedents from before the 1969 Powell v. McCormack decision, which considered moral character and past misconduct when assessing the "suitability," "fitness," or "qualifications" of a Member-elect, are now seen as having limited relevance due to this ruling. As detailed in Deschler's Precedents, the Powell decision effectively ended the practice of excluding Members-elect for prior criminal, immoral, or disloyal conduct.  There is no explicit constitutional limitation on Congress’s authority to expel a Member of Congress, other than the requirement for a two-thirds vote. One study of the expulsion clause noted that the Framers' intent was reflected in the history and deliberations surrounding Article I, Section 5, clause 2, which provides the basis for this power.
Justice Joseph Story concluded that it would be "difficult to draw a clear line between the power to expel a member and the power to impose any other punishment upon a member based on the time, place, or nature of the offense." He further noted that expulsion could be for any misdemeanor inconsistent with the trust and duty of a Member, even if such conduct was not punishable by statute or committed outside official sessions. The Supreme Court, citing Justice Story's treatise, affirmed that each house of Congress has broad authority to determine the grounds and timing for an expulsion, without established rights to judicial review.  In In re Chapman, the Supreme Court cited the Senate's expulsion of Senator William Blount as evidence supporting the constitutional authority of either house to punish a Member for conduct inconsistent with their duties, even if such conduct was not statutable or occurred outside official sessions. The Court highlighted that this process lacks many of the procedural protections found in criminal cases, leaving Members subject to nearly unbridled discretion from the charging body.
From whose decision there is no established right of review, it is likely that a court would find, similar to the Supreme Court's dicta in Brewster (regarding "no established right to review" of congressional disciplinary actions), that the expulsion of a Senator by the Senate (or a Representative by the House) is a non-justiciable "political question." Unlike the factual premise in Powell v. McCormack, where an exclusion based on qualifications other than those set forth in another constitutional provision was involved, an expulsion for misconduct would not appear to impinge upon any individual's constitutional rights or conflict with an express constitutional provision. Justice Douglas noted in his concurring opinion that "if this were an expulsion case I would think that no justiciable controversy were presented," highlighting the difference in justiciability between exclusion and expulsion cases.  The authority and power of each house of Congress to expel a member appear to be within broad discretion, as noted by the Supreme Court in dicta ("at the unbridled discretion of the charging body"). Policy considerations, rather than questions of power, may have generally restrained the Senate and the House from exercising this expulsion authority when the misconduct occurred prior to or during a previous Congress. At such times, the electorate was aware of the conduct but still reelected the member. Occasionally, this restraint has been characterized as evidence that "both Houses have distrusted their power to punish in such cases," according to dicta from the Supreme Court.  In Powell v.
Supreme Court Justice McCormack, in distinguishing between the exclusion and expulsion of Powell from Congress, noted that congressional precedents indicate the House generally does not expel a member for misconduct committed during an earlier Congress. However, the Court did not explicitly rule on whether the House has the authority to expel members for past misconduct. In his concurrence, Justice Douglas stated that if it were an expulsion case, "no justiciable controversy would be presented," as he agreed with Senator Murdock of Utah in a 1940 exclusion case that each house may expel anyone designated by a two-thirds vote.  The Supreme Court's assertion in Powell v. McCormack regarding the House's inability to expel for prior misconduct was based on the John W. Langley case, which involved multiple considerations. While the committee questioned whether the House could expel an individual who had been convicted of a crime "prior to his election as a Member," it also found that allowing such a person in the membership would imperil the House's integrity and dignity. The committee reported to the House that Representative Langley, whose criminal conviction appeal was pending, had agreed to not participate in House proceedings while the appeal was ongoing and to resign if his appeals were denied. After the Supreme Court denied his appeals, he resigned.  Moreover, many arguments against proceeding against a Member for misconduct in a prior Congress emphasized that the existing House should not recognize injuries to a past House's integrity or dignity. In contrast, the Senate considers itself a "continuing" body, suggesting that its historical actions might still affect current proceedings.
In the report on McCarthy’s censure, the Select Committee to Study Censure noted that precedents for expulsion or censure during a preceding Congress can be found in Hinds (op. cit., 1275-1289). However, House precedents cannot be considered binding since the House is not a continuous body. A careful examination of congressional precedents suggests that while there have been some doubts about the right to expel a Member for past misconduct when re-elected and aware by constituents, opinions on this matter have varied. For instance, during the Credit Mobilier investigations in the 42nd Congress in 1872, two different House committees offered conflicting views on the discipline of Representatives Ames and Brooks. Despite these differing viewpoints, the House chose to censure them rather than expel, explicitly rejecting a preamble that questioned their authority to act. Such discrepancies also occurred in other cases.  In contemporary congressional practice, and given Supreme Court rulings and interpretations, it is more accurate to say that reluctance to expel a Member after re-election stems from questioning the wisdom of such policies by either the Senate or House, rather than acknowledging an absence of constitutional power to act on past misconduct. This hesitation reflects a respect for the popular will and electoral choices made by constituents when a Member has been re-elected with knowledge of their conduct.
Although the indictment and alleged misconduct occurred after Senator Smith was elected to the Senate by the Ohio legislature, Senator Adams discussed the Senate's authority to expel a member, citing that "By the letter of the Constitution, the power of expulsion is given to each House of Congress without any limitation other than the two-thirds requirement." The select committee deemed this two-thirds requirement a wise and sufficient safeguard against potential abuse.   The difference between the "power" of the House to expel versus its judicious use as a "policy" was explained in a 1914 House Judiciary Committee report: According to your committee, the power of the House to expel or censure a member for misconduct occurring before their election or during a previous Congress is supported by the House's practices and is essential in extreme cases to exclude notoriously corrupt individuals who have dishonored themselves and betrayed the public.   However, when considering this issue and reaching our conclusions, it is important not to confuse the question of power with that of policy. From a sound policy perspective, this extraordinary prerogative should be exercised only in extreme circumstances, always with great caution, and particularly where acts of misconduct had become public before the member's election.
The exercise of such expulsion powers by the House could lead to an abuse of its constitutional authority if it were to substitute its standards and ideals for those of the constituency that elected its members as Representatives. Such a policy would undermine rather than preserve representative government. The power to expel is therefore used with caution, to prevent Congress from overstepping its institutional judgment in favor of the electorate's judgment on an individual Representative's character or fitness for office, whom the people have chosen through elections.  Originally, the Framers intended that voters maintain Representatives' ethical conduct and suitability for office through frequent elections. There is no explicit limitation in the Constitution or historical debates regarding Article I, Section 5, clause 2, nor has any judicial ruling placed such a restriction on the Senate's expulsion power. Expulsions have traditionally addressed cases of perceived disloyalty to the United States Government or violations of criminal statutory law involving abuse of office.
Notably, in 1995, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics recommended expelling a member for actions unrelated to any criminal charges, including allegations of sexual misconduct, misuse of authority for personal gain, and obstruction of their investigation. Historically, the U.S. Senate has expelled only 16 members: 14 during the Civil War for disloyalty to the Union (one later rescinded), and one in 1797 for other disloyal acts. Despite expelling few members since the Civil War, others have resigned when facing expulsion. In contrast, the House of Representatives has expelled five members—three during the Civil War for disloyalty, one in 1980 for bribery and conspiracy, and another in 2002 for corruption charges. Some representatives also chose to resign before potential expulsion. The Senate's precedent shows that it can independently investigate and decide on disciplinary actions even after a conviction, without waiting for all legal appeals to be exhausted. For instance, in the last expulsion case involving a sitting senator convicted of a crime, the Ethics Committee proceeded with their investigation and reported recommending expulsion before his appeals were concluded, suggesting further Senate deliberation post-appeals.
Following the conviction of a member, and until the full Senate considered the Ethics Committee's recommendation for expulsion, the convicted Senator continued to participate and vote on the Senate floor. Generally, it should be noted that while precedents from both the Senate and House of Representatives provide policy considerations and procedural guidance for disciplinary actions, these are not necessarily binding but are given significant weight in shaping individual cases.  The term "censure" is distinct from "expulsion," which does not appear explicitly in the Constitution. However, this authority is derived from Article I, Section 5, clause 2, of the Constitution, granting each house of Congress the power to punish its members for disorderly behavior. The Senate's Standing Orders state that the Ethics Committee may recommend disciplinary actions against a member, which can include censure, expulsion, or recommendations regarding seniority and committee positions.  In the Senate, "censure" traditionally signifies formal disapproval of a member’s conduct through a majority-vote resolution expressing condemnation or disapproval. Unlike expulsion, a censure does not automatically result in the forfeiture of rights or privileges; however, political party caucus rules may affect membership and leadership roles within the Senate.  The term "censure" encompasses any formal action by the Senate adopting a resolution that expresses disapproval, condemnation, denouncement, or general disapproval of a member's conduct, even if the word "censure" is not explicitly used in the resolution.
In the earliest Senate censure cases, historians and parliamentarians cite, the resolutions did not employ specific terms like "censure," "condemn," or "denounce." Instead, they merely stated findings and concluded that Senator Pickering in 1811 violated Senate rules; and Senator Tappan in 1844 was guilty of a flagrant violation and disregard for the Senate's authority. During the 1844 censure debate, it was noted that the absence of explicit disapproval language in the 1811 Pickering resolution was intended as a milder form of censure. Senators Bingham from Connecticut (1929) and McCarthy from Wisconsin (1954) were "condemned" by the full Senate; while McLaurin and Tillman from South Carolina (1902), and Dodd from Connecticut (1967), faced resolutions that used the term "censure." Talmadge in 1979 and Durenberger in 1990 were "denounced" by the Senate. The terms "condemn" have been used twice, in 1929 and 1954; historically, there was little distinction made between these terms and "censure," both seen as nearly synonymous at their time of use.  In the McCarthy censure case, the Select Committee recommended "censuring" him for two charges but reported favorably a resolution that condemned his conduct. During debate, Senator Watkins of Utah, who chaired the committee studying the censure charges, was questioned about the terms "censure" and "condemn."
Let me ask the Senator from Utah about his stance on adopting a censure resolution that primarily includes section 1, which uses the word "condemn," and how he now proposes to modify section 2 by adding "and condemn." How does this modification affect the proposed censure in section 2? Mr. WATKINS responded that the modification removes the term "censure." Mr. CASE noted that while the wording "and condemn" is included in section 1, the Senator from Utah still refers to the resolution as a censure resolution. Mr. WATKINS suggested this is a matter of semantics, with some viewing "condemn" as stronger than "censure," and others seeing it the other way around. The Select Committee during the McCarthy censure did not officially distinguish between these terms. However, at least one Senator felt that "condemn" was the more severe term, and this perception was not altered by the committee chairman's view. Currently, the use of "condemn" in a censure resolution might be perceived as stronger than just using "censure," partly because of its association with the late Senator Joseph McCarthy. In a later Senate discussion on a censure resolution, Senator Stennis of Mississippi stated that he believed "condemn" was more severe and harder than "censure." The term "denounce" has also been used in two recent censure resolutions in the Senate.
However, these actions should now be viewed as equivalent to censure but applied to special cases where a senator's financial duties have been grossly neglected and years of illegal activities by subordinates have been overlooked or even encouraged. Although the committee avoided using the term "censure," it employed words defined in terms of "censure" to address Senator Talmadge’s misconduct. The full Senate concluded that the term "denounce" was used to acknowledge mitigating circumstances, suggesting that the improprieties were not engaged in willfully or with actual knowledge, and thus censure would not be appropriate.  In its report on Senator Durenberger, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics did not explicitly state why it chose the term "denounce" over "censure" or "condemn." The committee's special counsel suggested that the precise verb in a censure resolution is less important than the characterization of the conduct in the formal resolution adopted by the full Senate. During Senate consideration, Senator Lott from Mississippi noted that an amendment to substitute "censure" for "denounce" was defeated, indicating that "denouncement," due to mitigating circumstances and lack of venal intent, was intended as a lesser term of disapproval.  Questions about the meaning of "denounce" were directed to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics, Senator Heflin from Alabama.
Some early commentators believed that the authority to censure or condemn a Member was strictly limited to cases involving disorderly or unruly behavior within Congress, such as conduct that disrupts the institution. However, congressional practice now recognizes and accepts that the power to discipline through censure extends to cases of "misconduct" outside of Congress, which the Senate or House deems reprehensible and reflects discredit on the institution. As stated in S.Rept. 2508, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954) by the Senate Select Committee: if a Senator engages in reprehensible conduct unrelated to their official duties but brings disrepute upon the Senate, the Senate has the power to censure that individual.  Similarly, the House of Representatives has taken a broad view of its authority to discipline Members through expulsion or censure. In the 63rd Congress, the House Judiciary Committee described the power to punish for disorderly behavior as "full and plenary," with the ability to be enforced by summary proceedings. They noted that this power is discretionary and subject only to the requirement of a two-thirds vote in cases of expulsion. The report on Representative Adam Clayton Powell stated that censure has been deemed appropriate in cases where there is a breach of the House's privileges, which are categorized into two classes: one affecting the collective rights and safety of the House, its dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings; and the other affecting individual Members' rights, reputation, and conduct as representatives.
Most cases of censure have involved unparliamentary language, assaults on a Member, or insults to the House through offensive resolutions. However, in five instances within the House (and one in the Senate as of 1969), censure was based on corrupt acts by Members, while another Senate case resulted from noncooperation and abuse of Senate committees.  The Constitution grants the House of Representatives discretionary power to punish disorderly behavior, which is appropriate for misconduct related to official duties, noncooperation with parliamentary committees, or nonofficial acts that could harm the House's reputation. Similarly, under Article I, Section 5, clause 2, and the Senate’s own rules and precedents, censure extends to misconduct or improprieties that may not violate specific statutes or written ethical codes but contravene "acceptable norms of ethical conduct," "good morals," or "senatorial ethics." Such actions can include behavior that detracts from the public trust expected of Senators or is deemed "reprehensible" and brings the Senate into disrepute.  It is worth noting that prior to 1968, there were no written Senate ethics rules. The first code of conduct was drafted in 1968, but it was explicitly stated that this written code would not override existing unwritten ethical standards used to judge Senators' behavior.
The 1964 resolution establishing and authorizing the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct (now known as the Select Committee on Ethics) was explicitly designed to ensure that this committee continued to possess the Senate’s traditional authority to investigate, make findings, and report matters of "misconduct" by Members or violations of specific rules, codes, or statutes related to official duties. The Senate has historically censured Members for actions such as breaching document secrecy, engaging in physical altercations, employing lobbyists on committees considering relevant legislation, failing to cooperate with Senate investigating committees, and financial improprieties concerning contributions, expenses, and outside income.  There is no precedent in the Senate for a full chamber resolution to "reprimand" a Member for misconduct or for any committee to recommend such an action. While both have been considered, the term "censure" has traditionally been employed, as it is viewed as less severe than "condemn." In the censure case of former Senator Thomas Dodd, Senator Tower proposed amending the resolution to substitute "reprimand" for "censure," arguing that this would allow the Senate to express its disapproval without the severity implied by censure. However, Senator Stennis, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, opposed using "reprimand," citing its lack of historical precedent in Senate procedure and suggesting that "censure" was more appropriate given the circumstances.
The matter was given careful consideration within our capacity, and we discovered that historically, for serious matters in the United States legislative history, the word "censure" or "condemn" has consistently been used. We found precedent in the House of Representatives where, following a resolution of censure, a Member would be required to appear at the bar of the House and receive a public reprimand from the Speaker. However, this practice was never adopted by the Senate.  We did not approve of requiring Senators to undergo such a procedure. In legislative parlance, "reprimand" does not carry significant weight; it merely serves as a mild form of disapproval. After thorough research, we concluded that "censure," while still being a mild term with legislative meaning, would better convey the Senate's stance on an issue. This was demonstrated in the case of Senators Tillman and McLaurin, who were censured by the full Senate in 1902 for fighting on the floor; the committee recommended censure as it deemed "reprimand" insufficiently severe to address their conduct.  Therefore, we opted for the word "censure," believing it to be the mildest term with a clear legislative connotation.
The Committee stated that the Senate can impose various penalties on South Carolina Senators, including fines, reprimands, imprisonment, suspension by a majority vote, or expulsion with two-thirds concurrence. The offense described in the majority report is not severe enough to warrant expulsion, and a reprimand would be insufficient. Following this, the Senate unanimously resolved that these Senators are in contempt and passed a resolution for a formal reprimand, which essentially restates their unanimous decision.  Prior to the 1970s in the House of Representatives, "reprimand" and "censure" were often synonymous terms used together in resolutions. For instance, in 1921, a House resolution instructed the Speaker to summon Representative Blanton of Texas and deliver both reprimand and censure. More recently, however, there has been a distinction: a "reprimand" signifies less severe disapproval than a "censure." In procedural terms, a House "censure" requires the Member to go to the well for a verbal rebuke by the Speaker, whereas a "reprimand" resolution is merely adopted without such a formal public statement.  In contrast, the Senate does not require a Member to go to the well. A formal censure resolution in the Senate has the same effect as a reprimand and could be considered equivalent or a form of "censure," similar to recent "denouncements" by the Senate.
A resolution in the Senate using the term "reprimand," despite lacking historical precedent, might be perceived as analogous to a minor rebuke similar to the House's modern practices. Such a reprimand could arguably be viewed by the public as a lesser form of institutional disapproval or discipline compared to the use of terms like "condemn," "censure," or "denounce." While not a formal disciplinary action employed by the full Senate, the Select Committee on Ethics can issue a reprimand or a similar rebuke in a report or letter to a particular member without requiring a vote from the full Senate. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics issued such a reprimand in 1991 concerning Senator Cranston and the "Keating Five" investigations, finding his conduct deserving of the strongest sanction within their authority, and thus strongly and severely reprimanding him. Although reported to the full Senate for discussion, no formal action was taken.  Under current rules, the Ethics Committee can issue a letter of admonition if an ethics violation is determined to be inadvertent, technical, or de minimis, noting that such letters are not considered discipline.   Notable examples include: 1. William Blount of Tennessee in 1797: A select committee found his attempt to incite Indians against U.S. government officials inconsistent with his public duty and recommended expulsion. 2. James M. Mason and Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia; Thomas L. Clingman and Thomas Bragg of North Carolina; and James Chestnut, Jr., also faced serious allegations but were not formally expelled.
On July 10, 1861, a resolution for the expulsion of Senators from states in rebellion was introduced into the Senate, recognizing that certain senators were "in arms against the Government" and had failed to appear or aid the government during this critical period. The resolution specifically named A.O.P. Nicholson from Tennessee; William K. Sebastian and Charles C. Mitchell from Arkansas; John Hemphill and Louis T. Wigfall from Texas. It stated these senators appeared engaged in a conspiracy to destroy the Union and Government, either by active participation or through willful silence. On July 11, 1861, the resolution was adopted by a vote of 32-10.  John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky faced expulsion on December 4, 1861, due to his alleged joining of enemies against the country and his service in opposition to the government he had sworn to support. The resolution was agreed to unanimously by a vote of 37-0.  Jesse D. Bright of Indiana was expelled from the Senate on February 5, 1862, after being charged with writing a letter in 1861 recommending an arms manufacturer to Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, which suggested disloyalty to the United States. Although the Judiciary Committee did not recommend expulsion, the full Senate voted to expel Bright by a margin of 32-14.  Waldo P. Johnson of Missouri was expelled on January 10, 1862, after failing to take his seat at the beginning of the session and not rebutting allegations of disloyalty to the Union. The Judiciary Committee found these actions provided strong evidence against his fidelity to the Union, leading to an expulsion resolution adopted by a vote of 35-0.  Trusten Polk of Missouri also faced expulsion proceedings but did not receive a specific date or outcome in the original text.
On January 10, 1862, the Judiciary Committee reported a resolution of expulsion against President Polk. It was concluded that Polk had written in a secession newspaper supporting Missouri's union with "her Southern sisters," failed to present himself to the Senate at the start of the session to address implications of disloyalty to the Union, and had secretly entered enemy territory. The resolution for expulsion passed unanimously, 36-0.  On January 2, 1811, Senator Thomas Pickering read a confidential letter from the French Minister of Foreign Affairs on the Senate floor, in violation of rules because the Senate was in session with open doors and the injunction of secrecy had not been removed. The resolution, after amendments to remove "palpable" and add "unintentional," passed by a vote of 20-7.  On May 10, 1844, Senator Benjamin Tappan delivered documents under order of secrecy to an individual who made them available to the press. The resolution stated that Tappan had violated Senate rules by making confidential documents public and disregarding the Senate's authority; it passed by a vote of 38-7.  On February 28, 1902, Senators John L. McLaurin and Benjamin R. Tillman engaged in a physical altercation on the Senate floor after exchanging disparaging remarks, resulting in Tillman striking McLaurin and both fighting until separated by others on February 22, 1902.
Immediately following an incident, a resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote of 61-0, declaring both Senators in contempt of the Senate and referring the matter to the Committee on Privileges and Elections with instructions to recommend appropriate action. The presiding officer ruled that these Members would not be recognized unless moved for by another Member and agreed upon by a majority of the Senate. Subsequently, the Committee on Privileges and Elections met and recommended a resolution of censure "for disorderly behavior and flagrant violation of the rules of the Senate during an open session." This resolution also stated that such Senators were "so censured for the breach of the privileges and dignity of this body." The order of February 22, which judged them in contempt, was declared no longer in force or effect. On February 28, 1902, a resolution of censure, effectively amounting to a six-day suspension, was agreed upon by a vote of 54-12.  In November 4, 1929, a special subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee investigated allegations that Senator Hiram Bingham from Connecticut improperly placed an individual on the Senate payroll. This person worked as a deputy and later a clerk for a committee, while also serving as a paid employee of the Manufacturers Association of Connecticut—a trade association with interests in tariff legislation. The employee had access to secret deliberations due to his position.  The subcommittee report (S.Rept. 43, 71st Cong., 1st Sess.) did not assert that this relationship violated any law or Senate rule. However, the full Judiciary Committee chairman introduced a resolution (S.Res. 146, 71st Cong.), condemning Bingham's actions as "contrary to good morals and senatorial ethics and tending to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute." This resolution was agreed upon by a vote of 54-22.  Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin faced similar scrutiny later in his career, though details of that specific incident are not provided here.
On December 2, 1954, Senator McCarthy faced investigation by the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections of the Rules and Administration Committee in 1951 and 1952 due to a resolution regarding alleged misconduct during an election after his Senate election. Initially, he sought to charge his accuser formally but later challenged the investigation as an attempt to expel him for exposing Communists in government. Although no disciplinary recommendation was made by the subcommittee, it criticized McCarthy for deliberately obstructing the investigation. In 1954, a resolution to censure Senator McCarthy was introduced and amended to include 46 specific counts of alleged misconduct (S.Res. 301, 83rd Cong., 2nd Sess.). The Select Committee to Study Censure examined these charges in five categories, including contempt of the Senate and obstruction of the legislative process (S.Rept. 2508, 83rd Cong., 2nd Sess.). After floor debate, the full Senate voted to "condemn" McCarthy on two counts: non-cooperation with and abuse of the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections in 1952, and abuse of the Select Committee to Study Censure. The modified resolution was adopted by a vote of 67-22.  In June 23, 1967, the Select Committee on Standards and Conduct investigated McCarthy for unethical conduct related to his relationship with a private businessman in West Germany; conversion of campaign contributions for personal use; free use of loaned automobiles; and acceptance of double reimbursements from both the Senate and private sources. The Committee recommended censure for using campaign funds for personal purposes and accepting double reimbursements, even though no law or Senate rule explicitly prohibited such actions. Although the testimonial dinners in question were deemed political in nature, the Committee found McCarthy "presumed" to have known their political character and thus should not have used their proceeds for his own benefit (S.Rept. 193, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 1967).
Following extensive debate on the resolution, the Senate rejected Senator Tower's amendment to substitute a "reprimand" for a "censure," among other proposed amendments. As a result, Senator Dodd was censured for his course of conduct, which involved using his influence and power as a United States Senator to obtain funds from public political testimonials and campaigns for personal benefit. Although this behavior did not violate any specific laws or Senate rules at the time, it was deemed "contrary to accepted morals," "derogatory to the public trust," and likely to bring the Senate into disrepute. The vote on censuring Senator Dodd was 92-5. On October 11, 1979, the Select Committee on Ethics investigated Senator Talmadge of Georgia for financial irregularities in his office, including excessive official reimbursements, inaccurate financial disclosures, late or improper filing of campaign reports, and the personal use of campaign funds, which potentially violated federal laws and Senate rules. The committee determined that Senator Talmadge either knew about these issues or should have known about them due to his gross neglect of duty in managing his office. As a result, the committee recommended censure for conduct that was "reprehensible" and likely to bring the Senate into disrepute. The full Senate adopted S.Res. 249 by a vote of 81-15. The committee specifically recommended using "denouncement" instead of "censure" because they felt this case had unique circumstances not similar to previous actions where the Senate had "censured" or "condemned" members, and wanted to ensure their judgment could be clearly understood without relying on historical analogies.
As noted earlier, the Senate's formal adoption of a resolution disapproving of a Senator's conduct is referred to by historians and parliamentarians as "censure." Expulsions in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are typically reserved for the most severe misconduct, such as disloyalty to the government or evidence of official corruption or abuse of office. Other than expulsion, censure is the strongest formal rebuke that the Senate can impose on its Members. Beyond a censure, the Senate might also require financial restitution from a Member, limit their privileges, or recommend to the appropriate party conference a reduction in seniority status for a Senator.  While there are no specific automatic penalties following a censure, public reprobation and formal rebuke by one's peers can have significant consequences. For instance, Senators subject to censure have faced challenges in recent elections. The full Senate formally adopts resolutions of disapproval against a Senator’s conduct through a vote requiring the majority present and voting. These resolutions, which may use terms like "condemning," "censuring," or "denouncing" without necessarily including explicit language of opprobrium, are considered by parliamentarians and historians as censure. There is no strict technical requirement for the wording used in such resolutions, nor do they follow a specific hierarchy of terminology.
Since Haiti declared independence in 1804 following the slave revolt against French colonial rule, its politics have been characterized by violence and authoritarianism. After Toussaint Louverture's leadership ended in 1803, successive despotic rulers held power until Francois Duvalier established a 30-year dictatorship that fell in 1986, declaring himself president for life along with his successor. This legacy has proven difficult to overcome. Many traditional centers of power, including the military, churches, business sector, and elite class, view democratic reform as threatening. The government still largely comprises Duvalierist appointees who have resisted change during subsequent governments and are likely to continue doing so.  Haitian history is marked by conflict between the mulatto elite and the majority black population. Most Haitians are poor, illiterate peasants of African descent. Mulattos established their dominance through control over the business sector. Both groups have had periods of political dominance; black rulers often emphasized Haiti’s African heritage and voodoo traditions, while mulattos favored a European, Catholic tradition. Despite mulattoes holding some government positions during black rule, race relations have improved in recent years with the Creole language gaining official status, interracial marriages becoming more common, and the government becoming less dominated by mulattoes.  However, recent political events have reignited racial and class tensions. The poor black majority’s access to power is limited to public protests when tolerated or through elections. Meanwhile, the mulatto elite wields significant economic and political influence in Haiti, often resisting changes that would redistribute wealth and privilege to benefit the poorer majority. For much of this century, Haitian history has been characterized by foreign intervention, notably U.S. military occupation from 1915 to 1934 aimed at ending civil strife and preventing German expansionism.
The Marines remained in Haiti until 1934, overseeing public works, tax collection, treasury management, and the establishment of Haiti’s first professional military force, a native Haitian Constabulary. While some contributions were beneficial, U.S. presence was widely resented as an infringement on Haitian sovereignty. Many viewed the U.S. intervention as discriminatory, with mulattoes occupying key positions despite the racial makeup of Haiti. By 1932, under President Herbert Hoover’s administration, the U.S. began withdrawing from Haiti following a commission established in 1930 that criticized the occupation for excluding Haitians from important governmental roles. In August 1933, an agreement led to the final departure of U.S. Marines by August 1934.  Francois Duvalier, known as "Papa Doc," ruled Haiti from 1957 until his death in 1971, followed by his son Jean-Claude for another decade. Papa Doc initially promised political liberty and social reform but soon established a dictatorship characterized by arbitrary imprisonment, torture, and mass killings. His private militia, the Tontons Macoutes, carried out much of this repression under the guise of maintaining order and countering potential military coups.  In 1964, Papa Doc amended the constitution to grant himself life presidency, and in his final months, he designated Jean-Claude as his successor. During "Baby Doc" Duvalier's rule, public resentment grew due to his marriage to a prominent mulatto and their lavish lifestyle, which starkly contrasted with the poverty of most Haitians. Fiscal corruption also became a significant issue. As popular dissatisfaction increased, so did the regime’s repressive measures, ultimately leading to widespread discontent.
In February 1986, facing significant popular demonstrations and international pressure, Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti for France. The United States facilitated his departure. After Aristide's ouster in 1991, Haiti experienced a series of governments over five-and-a-half years following Duvalier's exit. The first interim government was the National Council of Government (CNG), a six-member military-dominated body that disbanded the Tontons Macoutes and allowed for the drafting of a new constitution, which was reportedly approved by over 99% of Haitian voters in a plebiscite. This constitution guaranteed personal liberties, distributed power among a president, a prime minister, and two legislative houses, and transferred police responsibilities to the department of justice. It also created an independent electoral council for overseeing elections leading to civilian governance in February 1988. Candidates with ties to Duvalier's regime were prohibited from running.  However, Duvalierists, along with the army, disrupted November 1987 elections through violent campaigns that culminated in the killing of numerous voters; this violence led to the suspension of the elections. In January 1988, the CNG held its own election, widely seen as rigged in favor of Leslie Manigat, a long-exiled academic. However, less than six months later, on June 20, 1988, Manigat was deposed by a military coup when he attempted to replace officials and reform the government. Lt. General Henri Namphy, CNG president and close friend of Papa Doc, seized power.  During his 31-month tenure (February 1986 to September 1988), human rights violations increased under Namphy's rule, with numerous political killings reported. He was succeeded by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who promised a transition to democracy but continued to violate human rights according to reports from the U.S. State Department and other organizations. Violent popular protests forced Avril to resign after 18 months. Consequently, in March 1990, a civilian government was appointed with the mandate of holding elections as soon as possible. A coalition of political and civic organizations chose Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the sole woman on the Supreme Court, as provisional President. A State Council was also established to provide policy guidance to the executive branch.
The Council severed relations with the executive branch following its failure to consult the Council or take action against political violence. President Trouillot led a generally weak civilian government, which was unable or unwilling to effectively control the military. She established and cooperated with an independent electoral council that organized successful elections by year's end. Hopes for Haiti's transition from an authoritarian past were raised on December 16, 1990, when Haitians elected a President, national legislators, and municipal officials. Despite security concerns and limited democratic tradition, voter turnout was estimated at 70 percent on election day. International observers declared the elections generally free and fair.  These elections were partly due to a strong democratic movement that had emerged in the late 1980s, supporting an elected government committed to establishing order without repression. The movement included political parties as well as peasant, labor, human rights, and professional organizations. The success and relatively peaceful nature of the elections were also credited to the presence of international observers, whose assistance the Haitian government had requested, along with economic and material support from many nations and international organizations.  Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected President with 67.5 percent of the vote and inaugurated on the fifth anniversary of the collapse of the Duvalier dictatorship. As a 37-year-old populist Roman Catholic priest, he was one of 11 candidates approved by the independent Provisional Electoral Council (CEP). To his supporters, Aristide is a martyr who risks his life to defend the poor. An advocate of "liberation theology," he publicly opposed Duvalier and subsequent military rulers. In September 1988, an armed group attacked and burned his church, killing 13 and injuring 70; yet Aristide escaped unharmed with his parishioners.  To his detractors, Aristide is a potentially dangerous demagogue whose inflammatory oratory allegedly encourages dechoukajes—violent attacks on suspected Tontons Macoutes by angry mobs. Aristide reportedly denies that his book, 100 Verses of Dechoukaj, endorses violence.
Despite these challenges, the Salesian religious order expelled Aristide for preaching political matters from the pulpit, particularly what they termed "class struggle." When Aristide became a candidate, he moderated his revolutionary and anti-U.S. rhetoric. Previously, Aristide had opposed democratic elections in Haiti, arguing that free and fair elections were impossible as long as Duvalierists retained control of economic and political power. However, he entered the race in response to Roger Lafontant's potential candidacy.  Lafontant was disqualified from running for president, and in early January 1991, he attempted a coup against President Trouillot to prevent Aristide’s February 7th inauguration, branding him an "ultra-communist." The army arrested Lafontant and pledged to try him in civilian courts. Following the failed coup, violent celebrations erupted as crowds hunted down and lynched suspected Tontons Macoutes. Additionally, mobs burned the 220-year-old cathedral in apparent retaliation for a tense homily by the Archbishop, who had warned of an "authoritarian regime."  Many foreign diplomats criticized Aristide for not condemning the street violence swiftly enough. Upon assuming office, President Aristide faced some of the most severe and enduring social, economic, and political issues in the Western Hemisphere. Despite receiving mixed reviews after eight months, he was credited with reducing crime in the capital, cutting bloated state enterprises, and attempting to bring the military under civilian control.  Nevertheless, some observers questioned his government’s commitment to democracy. Neither Aristide nor his Prime Minister belonged to a political party, and other political leaders criticized him for failing to foster cooperation among democratic elements. Many legislators, including some from Aristide's coalition, protested his appointments of Supreme Court judges and ambassadors without consulting the Senate as required by the constitution. While he eventually agreed to consult the legislature, relations between branches remained tense.  Aristide was also criticized for his stance toward the judicial system; Lafontant was tried in July 1991 for his role in the January coup attempt.
Aristide called for a life sentence for Lafontant, which was carried out despite the constitutional limit of 15 years. The following day, Aristide declared a national holiday. Many observers expressed concern over the trial, noting its similarity to those under the Duvaliers in terms of length and lack of key witness testimony; additionally, five law trainees were appointed to defend Lafontant due to his lawyer deeming it too dangerous.  In July 1991, Aristide's government presented a macroeconomic reform and public sector investment plan to representatives from several nations and international lending institutions. The plan was well-received, with pledges of $440 million in FY1992 aid. Most of this aid was later suspended due to the coup that overthrew Aristide on September 30, 1991.  Regarding human rights, President Aristide faced mixed reviews. He was criticized for seemingly condoning mob violence but was credited with significantly reducing violations during his tenure. Some observers believe Aristide contributed to polarizing Haiti by refusing to condemn violent retribution and implicitly threatening "pere lebrun," or burning someone alive with a gasoline-soaked tire.  For instance, after sentencing the former head of Tontons Macoutes to life in prison, Aristide gave a speech praising popular pressure and the threat of "pere lebrun." In a September 27, 1991, address, he appeared to threaten former Tontons Macoutes with this practice. Aristide reportedly said, "You are watching all macoute activities throughout the country. We are watching and praying. If we catch one, do not fail to give him what he deserves. What a nice tool! What an instrument!"
It is stipulated by the Constitution that macoutes are banned from the political scene. (5) While in exile, Aristide condemned necklacing. (6) Observers also claim that in his speech, he threatened the bourgeoisie for insufficient support of his government. (7) Some view this speech as a contributing factor to his overthrow just days later, suggesting that members of the bourgeoisie were financially backing the coup leaders. In a report on the Aristide government's human rights record, Americas Watch and two other human rights organizations noted: It is unfortunate but understandable how speeches in support of Pere Lebrun overshadowed those advocating lawful redress for abuse. President Aristide had an obligation to avoid any statements that could be interpreted as supporting Pere Lebrun and to firmly condemn the barbaric practice. His failure to do so constitutes a significant blemish on his human rights record. (8) The report also aligned with international community views by recognizing Aristide as the "sole legitimate Haitian head of state," elected with a two-thirds majority, an unusual mandate in the hemisphere. It stated: While acknowledging the need to address the human rights shortcomings of the Aristide government, we firmly believe that these failings cannot justify depriving the Haitian people of their right to elect their own government. (9) Most human rights monitors credit Aristide's government for being the first to address the need to improve respect for human rights and support for the poor majority. They assert that progress made during his tenure was undone by the subsequent military regime. Sources also commend Aristide for significantly enhancing security in Haiti, reducing common crime in cities and bringing greater safety to rural areas through the removal of long-standing "chefs desections," or sheriffs, who had ruled through extortion and violence. According to State Department human rights reports for 1991 and 1992, there were no reports of disappearances during Aristide's term, with numerous reports in the months following the coup.
Following Aristide's ousting, the number of political killings dramatically increased. The September 1991 coup began just four days after Aristide addressed the United Nations, an event he reportedly viewed as marking the end of Haiti's dark past of dictatorship. The State Department estimated that between 300 and 500 people died due to the coup, while Amnesty International put the number at over 1,500.  During military-dominated interim governments, the Haitian army frequently hindered the democratic process. However, after the last military dictator left in March 1990, some observers believed there had been a transformation of the army into one supportive of democracy. Throughout the 1990 electoral process, the 7,000-man army demonstrated its capability to establish and maintain order. This change was attributed to several factors: the attrition of anti-democratic elements with the downfall of interim governments; the army's inability to form a viable government; a new generation of officers interested in reform and professionalization of the armed forces; and growing domestic and international pressure for civilian democracy.  Initially, the army accepted Aristide's assertion of authority, including his purge of the Haitian army high command. Brigadier General Cedras, who oversaw security for the December elections, reportedly participated reluctantly in the coup. Nevertheless, as the army's spokesman, he claimed that Aristide was ousted for "meddling in army affairs." Some analysts argue that the army does not want to relinquish control because it profits from contraband- and narcotics-trafficking.  Despite efforts by the Aristide government to implement civilian authority over the military—such as separating the police from the army, with the police under the Ministry of Justice—the military resisted. The constitution also mandated that cases involving military abuses against civilians be tried in civilian courts rather than by the military, but the military had previously resisted such laws. No military personnel were prosecuted for human rights abuses under any of the interim governments.  When Aristide was overthrown, he was embarking on an attack on corruption and pushing reforms within the army while also creating a civilian police force. The State Department's 1991 human rights report noted that the military's trend toward improved human rights under the Aristide government reversed after the coup.
Crime is typically prohibited, tried, and punished according to the laws of the jurisdiction where it occurs. However, American criminal law can apply beyond U.S. borders under certain circumstances, particularly for multi-jurisdictional crimes involving actions both within a state and overseas. While many federal criminal statutes have extraterritorial reach, actual prosecutions remain relatively rare due to practical, legal, and sometimes diplomatic complexities.  The Constitution does not prevent either Congress or the states from enacting laws with foreign application. Moreover, it explicitly grants Congress the authority to define and punish certain crimes committed on the high seas and against international law. It also empowers Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and to pass necessary and proper laws for executing these powers.  Specifically, the Constitution's grant of power "[t]o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations," along with the "Necessary and Proper" clause, has been used as a basis for enacting extraterritorial criminal legislation, especially in maritime contexts. Similarly, Congress's commerce powers, particularly those vested in "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations," allow it to create criminal statutes that apply beyond U.S. borders, even if the acts occur on American vessels within another nation’s territory.
The two Commerce Clause powers enable Congress to regulate interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes, while courts frequently invoke these provisions broadly. The Foreign Commerce Clause might be even more extensive, though some argue otherwise. Recent court cases have adopted a moderate stance; one ruled that Congress had the authority to prohibit illicit overseas commercial sexual activities committed by Americans traveling abroad. Despite a strong dissent, the panel did not address whether it would reach the same conclusion if the defendant had not agreed to pay for his actions or any other commercial factor. Another court construed the statute narrowly to avoid ruling on the extent of Congress's foreign commerce powers. A third case concluded that Congress could regulate channels of U.S. foreign commerce but deferred questions regarding domestic impacts and whether similar standards apply internationally.  Two circuits, however, have adopted a more expansive view. The Eleventh Circuit has held that Congress’s foreign commerce power mirrors its interstate commerce authorities on "channels," "instrumentalities," and "substantive effect." The Fourth Circuit extended this to include the authority to regulate any activities demonstrably affecting U.S. foreign commerce. Beyond its enumerated powers, Congress frequently uses extraterritorial legislation to support other branches' powers or share them through the necessary and proper clause.
Although American courts that try aliens for overseas violations of U.S. law must adhere to due process, the Supreme Court has noted that the Constitution's due process protections do not extend to aliens with no "significant voluntary connections" to the United States. Furthermore, recent Supreme Court decisions often presuppose that extraterritorial jurisdiction does not raise constitutional concerns. However, due process issues have begun to emerge in a growing number of lower court rulings concerning extraterritoriality. Some courts have invoked a due process requirement mandating a connection between the U.S. and the offense's circumstances. Occasionally, these courts refer to international law principles or the minimum contacts test for personal jurisdiction as benchmarks. At the core of these cases is the idea that due process demands a defendant’s conduct must have some past, present, or anticipated impact within the United States before they can be fairly held criminally liable in an American court. Commentators have greeted this analysis with skepticism, and certain courts have outright rejected it.  A related due process challenge focuses on notice. This issue is similar to concerns about secret laws and vague statutes, which typically do not excuse ignorance of the law. In these cases, factors such as knowledge, reason to know, obligation to know, or reasonable ignorance—some of which are influenced by international standards—appear most relevant. For instance, citizens should be aware of their nation’s laws; seafarers must understand maritime law and the laws of the country under whose flag they sail; and individuals should be mindful of the laws of the territory in which they find themselves as well as universal prohibitions against certain wrongs.
On the other hand, applying an American criminal statute to an alien in a foreign country where such conduct is lawful under their laws might indicate a lack of sufficient notice, potentially raising due process concerns. However, courts generally hold that questions of extraterritoriality are primarily within Congress's discretion; granting a statutory provision extraterritorial application, regardless of its policy implications, does not inherently violate constitutional norms. Consequently, the extent to which a statute applies outside the United States is typically considered a matter of statutory rather than constitutional construction.  Statutory construction rules have been established, offering guidance on these matters. One rule states that if a statute does not address overseas application, it should be construed as having only territorial applicability unless there are clear indications of broader intent. Additionally, when a statute does permit some extraterritorial application, the presumption against such application limits its scope to the statutory terms.  Initially, another construction rule suggested that the nature and purpose of a statute might indicate congressional intent for overseas application. Although hinted at earlier, this was first clearly articulated in United States v. Bowman. The Supreme Court's strong support for the domestic presumption in Morrison cast doubt on Bowman’s continued relevance. Early reactions indicated courts and commentators were reluctant to fully abandon Bowman. However, in RJR Nabisco, another civil case, the Court seemingly targeted Bowman without directly naming it. It remains uncertain whether the Court still considers Bowman a valid precedent.  Lastly, unless there is clear evidence of contrary intent, Congress is presumed to have acted to avoid actions that would be inconsistent with international law.
At one time, legal cases suggested an implicit rule: unless Congress explicitly stated its intent for a statute to apply overseas to both aliens and Americans, it would be presumed to apply only to citizens. However, as discussed below, this presumption seems less compelling given the flexible interpretation of international grounds that support claims. International law does not dictate but rather influences decisions regarding the extraterritorial application of American law; neither Congress nor courts are bound by such dictates when enacting or interpreting statutes with extraterritorial effects. Nevertheless, Congress considers international law in evaluating policy implications of legislation that may have global consequences.  For this reason, courts interpret legislation under a presumption that Congress intends its laws to be applied within the bounds of international law, unless otherwise indicated. To what extent does international law permit a nation to exercise extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction? This question fundamentally concerns national interests: what interest is served by such application and what are the potential impacts on other nations?  The most common classification of these interests traces back to a 1935 Harvard Law School study, which categorized them into five principles based on the circumstances under which a nation declared its criminal laws applicable. These include: (1) the territorial principle, involving crimes occurring or impacting within a country’s territory; (2) the nationality principle, concerning crimes committed by nationals; (3) the passive personality principle, covering crimes against nationals; (4) the protection principle, addressing crimes that affect national interests; and (5) the universal principle, encompassing universally condemned crimes.  The American Law Institute's Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States offers a comprehensive, contemporary statement on international law in this area.
The reasonableness standard delineates the latitude international law grants to countries for enacting, trying, and punishing extraterritorial violations of their laws. This standard is assessed through a balancing of interests as outlined in the Harvard study principles. While the Restatement's perspective holds significant weight with both Congress and courts, judicial interpretation typically relies on these principles, often interpreted broadly. The territorial principle from the Harvard study extends beyond its title to include conduct within a nation’s geographical borders, as well as activities on its territorial waters, on vessels in international waters, and elsewhere that have an impact within its territory. Congress frequently specifies a statute's application to a country's territorial waters and vessels through the text of the legislation. Courts consistently recognize the "impact" basis for extraterritorial claims, especially when other principles of international law are involved.  The protective principle is more restrictive, covering crimes committed abroad that threaten a nation’s security, territorial integrity, or political independence. However, courts have interpreted this principle to include statutes protecting federal government and its functions, such as the overseas murder or attempted murder of federal officers, acts of terrorism influencing American foreign policy, conduct threatening U.S. national security, false statements or forgery hindering immigration law administration, entering the United States surreptitiously, or overseas bribery related to federal contracts.  The nationality principle grants extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction based on the citizenship of the accused.
The principle illustrated in the Supreme Court's ruling in Blackmer v. United States, following the contempt conviction of an American residing in Paris who defied a federal court subpoena, mirrors this concept. Similar to the case of Blackmer, which highlights both nationality and protective principles, cases involving the nationality principle often intersect with other principles as well.  The passive personality principle grants extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction based on the victim's nationality, a notion that has frequently been invoked in scenarios suggesting alternative principles. The universal principle asserts that offenses against all nations may be punished by any nation where the perpetrator is found; it primarily applies to piracy and crimes committed on high seas "stateless" vessels.  Congressional declarations that specific statutes should apply outside U.S. borders are the clearest indication of intent to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction. Congress has most often achieved this through legislation that criminalizes various misconduct when it occurs within the "special maritime and territorial jurisdiction" of the United States, a concept dating back to the First Congress and encompassing navigable waters, federal enclaves, and areas beyond U.S. territorial confines.  The idea of special maritime and territorial jurisdiction has expanded beyond its initial scope, which included state-like legislative jurisdiction over certain places, U.S. navigable territorial waters, and U.S.-flagged vessels. Statutory expansions now provide a clear basis for the extraterritorial application of various federal criminal laws related to air travel (special aircraft jurisdiction), customs matters (customs waters of the U.S.), U.S. spacecraft in flight, stateless submersibles on the high seas, overseas federal facilities and residences of federal employees, members of the U.S. Armed Forces stationed abroad and their dependents, and human trafficking and sex offenses committed by federal employees outside the country.
Military personnel, including those they accompany, are subject to federal criminal statutes with explicit extraterritorial application derived from various international treaties, conventions, or agreements that the United States has ratified. These statutes cover a range of offenses. Some apply only if the offender is an American, while others address universally condemned misconduct that falls under U.S. jurisdiction regardless of where it occurs, as long as the individual is found in the United States after committing the offense, or is brought here for prosecution. Other statutes have extraterritorial application under multiple explicit circumstances, including those involving foreign commerce.  Another category of explicit extraterritorial federal criminal statutes may either vaguely state that their provisions apply overseas or specify a series of jurisdictional conditions under which they do so, often involving U.S. foreign commerce in conjunction with other factors. The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) is somewhat unique, as it authorizes the application of U.S. criminal law based solely on the consent of the nation where primary criminal jurisdiction lies.  Under MDLEA, the manufacture, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute controlled substances aboard vessels within U.S. jurisdiction are prohibited. This includes not only ordinary U.S. maritime vessels but also vessels from other countries that have consented to the application of U.S. law on board. The definition further encompasses "vessels without nationality," commonly known as stateless vessels, which are those for which no national registry is effectively claimed.  MDLEA forms the legal basis for Coast Guard drug interdiction efforts in regions such as the Caribbean and off the coasts of Central and South America. U.S. courts have ruled that MDLEA constitutes a valid exercise of Congress's constitutional authority to define and punish felonies on the high seas and offenses against international law.
There is debate over whether the prosecution must establish a connection between the United States and the offense, and regarding how the court should determine jurisdiction under the relevant act's provisions rather than relying on jury decisions. Prior to the cases of Morrison and RJR Nabisco, lower courts interpreted Bowman and Ford to imply that many federal crimes apply overseas due to Congress’s implied intent. Specifically, they construed these precedents as suggesting that U.S. extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction extends to statutes protecting federal officers, employees, and property; preventing smuggling; and deterring the obstruction or corruption of overseas activities by federal departments and agencies.  For example, courts ruled that a statute prohibiting the assassination of Members of Congress could be applied against an American who committed murder abroad, and that statutes barring the murder or kidnapping of federal law enforcement officials apply in other countries, even if the perpetrators are not Americans and even if they mistakenly believed their victims were federal officers. Additionally, extraterritorial jurisdiction was deemed appropriate for cases where aliens attempted to defraud the U.S. to gain entry; false statements made by Americans overseas; theft of federal property abroad; counterfeiting or misusing federal documents or checks in foreign lands by Americans or foreigners; and murder of a foreign national intended to aid criminal enterprises within the U.S.  RJR Nabisco casts significant doubt on the continued validity of these interpretations, particularly when no clear textual, structural, or contextual evidence indicates that Congress intended such statutes to apply abroad. This uncertainty applies equally to earlier jurisprudence, which might have led one to conclude that statutes aimed at preventing and punishing the theft of federal property should be applicable worldwide.
There appeared to be no clear rationale for treating statutes protecting the U.S. from intentional deprivation of its property through destruction differently from those addressing loss due to theft. The RJR Nabisco Court, however, did endorse implied extraterritoriality in "piggyback" statutes like conspiracy, attempt, and aiding and abetting, as these provisions necessarily depend on another crime. Earlier cases occasionally suggested that an individual could be guilty of conspiracy to violate a U.S. federal law even if they never entered the country; it was sufficient that they were part of a conspiracy to commit such violations. This rationale was similarly applied to accessories to overseas federal crimes and to "piggyback" offenses where criminal liability hinged on an offense applicable abroad. The Court in RJR Nabisco seemed to agree, stating: "Congress's inclusion of these (and other) extraterritorial elements into RICO provides a clear indication that [RICO's prohibitions] apply to foreign racketeering activity—but only to the extent that the predicates alleged in a particular case themselves extend extraterritorially." State criminal laws are less likely to be applied overseas than federal laws, as state statutes typically do not clearly aim for international application and often face difficulties when applied territorially. The Constitution seems to have assigned the primary responsibility for protecting American interests abroad to the federal government. While the primacy of the federal government in foreign affairs might suggest that states cannot apply their laws internationally, courts and commentators recognize a limited power of states to enact laws governing conduct outside U.S. borders. Congress can preempt state legislative authority in areas where it has plenary powers, and the Supremacy Clause ensures that treaties binding on the United States are also binding on the states, thus limiting their legislative reach.
Despite constitutional constraints and the lack of federal legislative action, "the question is not whether a state has the power to legislate extraterritorially, but whether it actually intended to do so." States have opted to make their laws applicable beyond their borders in limited circumstances, typically where there is a clear connection to the state. Common state statutes assert jurisdiction when some elements of an offense are committed within the state's boundaries or others occur elsewhere. Another frequent assertion involves cases where an individual outside the state attempts or conspires to commit a crime within it; or vice versa. Additionally, states may extend their extraterritorial jurisdiction in scenarios such as homicide victims who were fatally wounded outside the state but died within its borders; property theft from another location that is brought into the state; or conduct occurring outside the state that constitutes a failure to comply with a legal duty imposed by state law.  Although many federal criminal statutes have clear extraterritorial application, and numerous others were thought to potentially apply beyond the country’s borders, few prosecutions have actually taken place. Investigators and prosecutors encounter significant legal, practical, and often diplomatic challenges that can be overwhelming. These obstacles are exemplified in the procedural aspects of prosecuting crimes committed abroad as detailed below.  Regarding diplomatic concerns, according to the Restatement: "It is universally recognized, as a corollary of state sovereignty, that officials from one state may not exercise their functions within another state's territory without its consent." Consequently, while a state can undertake certain non-judicial enforcement measures against an individual in another state, law enforcement officers cannot make an arrest without the other state's permission. They can conduct criminal investigations only with the explicit consent of that state.
Failure to comply with international protocols can lead to strong diplomatic protests, liability for reparations, and other remedial actions, not to mention potential criminal prosecution of offending investigators. Consequently, investigations into extraterritorial federal crimes within another country without host country consent or acquiescence are exceptionally rare.  Congress has supported efforts to enhance multinational cooperative law enforcement activities through the establishment of mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs). The United States currently maintains over 70 active MLATs, which provide benefits often accessible to state and federal law enforcement agencies via the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs. Initially negotiated to overcome impediments posed by foreign bank secrecy laws, these treaties generally offer more than just document collection and delivery. They typically include provisions for locating and identifying persons and items; serving process; executing search warrants; taking witness depositions; persuading foreign nationals to voluntarily present evidence in the United States; and seizing assets related to forfeiture.  Witness depositions can be conducted abroad through letters rogatory, which involve formal requests from one country’s courts to another to take a witness's statement. This procedure is governed by statute and rule but often serves as a last resort due to its time-consuming nature and reliance on the discretion of the foreign court involved.  American law enforcement officials have traditionally employed other, more informal cooperative methods overseas to investigate and prosecute extraterritorial offenses. Over recent decades, the United States has taken steps to facilitate such efforts, including the deployment of increasing numbers of personnel from various federal civilian law enforcement agencies abroad. For example, the Department of Justice's Criminal Division now has resident legal advisors in 45 countries; the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operates legal attache offices in 78 foreign cities; and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) maintains offices in 92 overseas cities.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency operates from 75 locations, while the Secret Service has 20 such offices. Several regulatory agencies with law enforcement duties collaborate with their foreign counterparts. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission works with over 105 foreign regulatory bodies and is a signatory of the International Organization of Securities Commissions' multilateral memorandum of understanding (IOSCO MMOU) for enforcement cooperation and information exchange.  Congress has established measures to ensure reciprocal treatment of foreign law enforcement efforts within the country. The Foreign Evidence Request Efficiency Act of 2009, for example, authorizes Justice Department attorneys to petition federal judges for various orders to facilitate investigations by foreign authorities in this country, including search warrants; court orders for access to stored electronic communications and records; pen register or trap and trace orders; and subpoena authority for both testimonial evidence and the production of documents and other materials.  Searches and seizures conducted abroad can have Fourth Amendment implications. According to the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches of foreign nationals' property outside the United States unless the owner has significant voluntary connections with the U.S. The application of the Fourth Amendment to U.S. citizens and those with substantial ties to the U.S. remains less clear. Prior to the Verdugo-Urquidez decision, neither the Fourth Amendment nor its exclusionary rule were generally applicable to overseas searches by foreign law enforcement officials, except in two circumstances: when such actions "shocked the conscience" of the court or when U.S. law enforcement officials played a substantial role as part of a joint venture.  These exceptions often lacked clear application and typically did not apply universally; they usually only extended to situations involving the property or person of U.S. nationals. In the era before Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) were commonly used, courts rarely encountered cases sufficient to invoke these exceptions.
Since the Verdugo-Urquidez decision, courts have generally held that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches or seizures of U.S. citizens by foreign officials in other countries, though they occasionally recognize exceptions such as "joint venture" and "shocked conscience." Before Verdugo-Urquidez, lower federal appellate courts largely agreed that the Fourth Amendment governed foreign searches and seizures conducted by U.S. law enforcement officials on U.S. citizens. Post-Verdugo-Urquidez, the primary question has been what standards the Fourth Amendment requires rather than whether it applies. Typically, a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate based on probable cause is necessary for a reasonable search or seizure in this country. Two concurring opinions in Verdugo-Urquidez and subsequent court rulings suggest that U.S. officials conducting searches abroad do not need to obtain such warrants unless the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or other authorizations apply.  However, it remains true that "the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard applies to United States officials conducting a search affecting a United States citizen in a foreign country," provided that the search conforms to foreign law. Under the good faith exception, such searches may be upheld when U.S. officials reasonably rely on foreign officials' representations of applicable law.  Similarly, statements made abroad by U.S. citizens to foreign officials are not protected by the Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause and its Miranda requirements, with exceptions for "joint venture" and "shocked conscience." However, these protections do apply when American officials conduct custodial interrogations of individuals abroad, regardless of their nationality.  Lastly, as a general rule, any confession or other incriminating statements must be freely made to be admissible in U.S. courts. Additionally, prosecution for federal crimes generally must commence within five years.
Federal capital offenses, certain federal sex offenses, and various violent federal terrorist offenses can be prosecuted at any time. Nonviolent federal terrorism offenses must commence within eight years. The statute of limitations is suspended or tolled during periods when the accused is a fugitive. Regardless of the applicable statute of limitations, Section 3292 permits federal courts to suspend it for pending evidence requests from foreign governments: Upon the U.S.'s application before indictment, indicating that evidence relevant to an offense is in another country, the district court conducting the grand jury investigation can suspend the statute of limitations if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a request has been made officially and reasonably believed at the time to be for evidence in that foreign country. Suspensions under Section 3292 may last up to six months if the requested assistance is provided before the statute of limitations expires, or up to three years otherwise. The suspension begins when the request is filed and ends with final action by the foreign government. To use this provision, the government must demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that the purpose was to obtain overseas evidence. Despite these time limits, the government does not need to prove that it acted diligently in gathering such evidence.  Regarding the statute's applicability, there is divided opinion among circuits regarding whether Section 3292 can revive a statute of limitations after it has expired or extend it for evidence already obtained at the time of the request.
At least one court has interpreted the statutory reference to "the district court before which a grand jury is impaneled to investigate the offense" to mean that it identifies the court with the authority to issue suspension orders, rather than limiting such requests to cases involving pending grand jury investigations.  Extradition, a foundational aspect of international law enforcement cooperation, involves the surrender of fugitives from one country to another for prosecution or serving a sentence. The United States maintains bilateral extradition treaties with approximately two-thirds of the world's countries. Early U.S. extradition agreements, established before 1960 and still in force, reflect the prevailing view that criminal jurisdiction was territorial, thereby barring extradition for crimes committed outside national territories. Modern agreements have evolved to either mandate extradition regardless of where the offense occurs or allow it if the offenses are compatible under both countries' laws.  More recent treaties address other traditional limitations, such as the nationality exception, political offense exceptions, and exclusions based on specific types of offenses. Federal crimes committed abroad are typically perpetrated by individuals residing in those countries. Nevertheless, most current treaties include provisions ensuring that neither party will extradite its own citizens or subjects unless compelled otherwise.  The political offense exception is now a standard clause in nearly all international extradition agreements. Initially intended to protect unsuccessful insurgents fleeing prosecution, it is commonly interpreted to encompass not only purely political offenses like treason and sedition but also related offenses such as violence committed during revolutionary activities.
The exception to this rule somewhat contradicts modern efforts to prevent, prosecute, and punish acts of terrorism. Therefore, recent treaties often include limitations on this exception, sometimes with a discretionary right to refuse politically or otherwise discriminatory extradition requests. Prior to the 1980s, U.S. extradition treaties generally listed specific crimes; for instance, the first treaty limited offenses to murder and forgery, whereas by the late 20th century, standard lists included more than 30 crimes. More recent treaties tend to use a broader description.  In cases where a suspect is not a citizen of the country providing refuge, foreign authorities might agree to expel or deport him, allowing U.S. authorities to take custody. Absent specific treaty provisions, federal courts retain jurisdiction to try a defendant who was abducted and brought to the United States for trial rather than pursuant to an extradition request.  Federal crimes committed within the United States must be tried where they occurred, while crimes committed abroad are tried according to statutes Congress has enacted. Section 3238 of Title 18 permits extraterritorial crimes to be tried either in the district into which the offender was first brought or arrested, or prior to that, by indictment or information in the district of their last known residence or, if unknown, in the District of Columbia. The term "first brought" refers to when the offender is initially taken into custody, and "arrested" applies when an accused is initially detained under an indictment subsequently dismissed.  The venue for joint offenders can be wherever venue is proper for one of them, as suggested by the language of Section 3238.
Courts are split on whether Section 3238 can be applied even if venue was properly established without its use. Occasionally, Congress enacts specific provisions for the venue of offenses committed abroad, such as the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act and the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA). The Controlled Substance section bans overseas possession with intent to import into the United States, while MDLEA prohibits possession of controlled substances on vessels under U.S. jurisdiction. Both acts include parallel venue provisions that permit trials in the district where the accused enters the United States or in the District of Columbia.  Federal courts can issue subpoenas for U.S. residents or nationals found abroad to appear before them or a grand jury, but generally lack authority to subpoena foreign nationals located outside the country. Mutual legal assistance treaties and similar agreements typically provide mechanisms for transferring custody of imprisoned foreign witnesses from their home countries and otherwise facilitating voluntary testimony by foreign nationals.  When unable to secure the presence of foreign witnesses, Federal Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows courts to authorize depositions taken abroad under "exceptional circumstances and in the interests of justice." Such depositions can be admitted as evidence in criminal trials provided they meet the demands of the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Confrontation Clause. Initially, only defendants could request these depositions, but prosecutors have been able to do so since the 1970s.  The Rule offers depositions as an alternative to long-term incarceration of material witnesses. Otherwise, such orders can be issued only in exceptional circumstances. Some courts require that "establishing exceptional circumstances involves showing the witness's unavailability and the materiality of their testimony." Others might add that the necessity is to prevent a failure of justice or include additional considerations.
Depositions are generally to be conducted similarly to those in civil cases, adhering to Rule 15's requirements. The rule also mandates that defendants have an opportunity to attend depositions initiated by the government. When a deposition is taken abroad, courts prefer that the defendant be present, counsel be allowed to cross-examine the witness, the deposition be taken under oath, a verbatim transcript be prepared, and it be recorded on videotape. However, evidence from such depositions may still be admitted in U.S. criminal trials even if some of these optimal conditions are absent. In countries where legal requirements or practices do not conform to U.S. standards for such depositions, treaty provisions often address the issue.  The government typically takes depositions under circumstances that would allow their use as evidence at trial, but compliance with Rule 15 is a necessary condition rather than sufficient for deposition admissibility. The ultimate question of admissibility hinges on whether Confrontation Clause requirements are met. This clause guarantees not only face-to-face confrontation but also the right to cross-examine and expose the witness's demeanor to the jury.  Early Supreme Court cases, such as Ohio v. Roberts and Maryland v. Craig, provided guidance. Craig established that the physical presence requirement for trial testimony can be waived under certain circumstances, considering public policy and case necessities. Roberts addressed whether hearsay evidence could be admitted without violating the Confrontation Clause, concluding that such evidence is admissible if it falls within a "firmly rooted hearsay exception."  Following these cases, Crawford v.[*] further refined the application of the Confrontation Clause in the context of remote testimony and hearsay.
Washington held that testimonial hearsay cannot be admitted into evidence without cross-examination, deeming it unreliable. Crawford invalidates the across-the-board hearsay rule exception established in Roberts when dealing with "testimonial" depositions at trial. It firmly rejects any suggestion that Roberts allows less than actual confrontation for such testimonies. The status of Craig's video and public interest exception is uncertain. At least one appellate panel concluded that a prosecution’s need for critical evidence alone does not suffice to qualify for the Craig exception, while another held that national security interests could do so. Pre-Crawford cases required a good faith effort to secure the defendant's attendance at overseas depositions; thus, it might be argued that Crawford does not necessitate changes in this area. The Eleventh Circuit’s en banc Craig analysis suggested that overseas depositions were more compatible with the confrontation clause than video trial testimony. However, the Fourth Circuit later dismissed a Confrontation Clause challenge to an overseas deposition where circumstances met both Craig requirements: denial of face-to-face confrontation due to important policy considerations and assurance of reliability through an oath, cross-examination, and observation of the witness’s demeanor. The Federal Rules of Evidence govern federal criminal trials; thus, depositions taken overseas that pass scrutiny under Rule 15 are likely admissible, with the hearsay rule, Rule 802, posing the most significant obstacle due to its preference for adversarial exposure.
The Rule includes an explicit exception for depositions that have been used in foreign settings under its authority. When witnesses or evidence are located abroad, a defendant's rights may conflict with the government’s need for secrecy due to diplomatic and national security concerns. According to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, defendants are entitled to disclosure of their statements held by the prosecution; however, the prosecution’s case might have originated from foreign intelligence operations. The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant's right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, but providing such a witness, who is also a terrorist suspect and in federal custody, could adversely affect the witness’s value as an intelligence source. It ensures the defendant's right to confront witnesses against him, including those presenting classified information. Congress has provided the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) to resolve these conflicts by allowing courts to approve summaries of classified information for disclosure to defendants and use in evidence. These summaries must adequately replace the original classified information to ensure the government’s national security interests do not override the defendant's right to a fair trial.  There is also a statutory procedure designed to facilitate the admission of foreign business records in federal courts. This section covers "foreign records of regularly conducted activity" in any form, including memoranda, reports, or data compilations maintained abroad. It exempts qualified business records from hearsay rules in federal criminal proceedings and allows their authentication with foreign certification. Additionally, it establishes a procedure for challenging the reliability of these documents during pre-trial motions.
While the failure to provide timely notice does not always preclude the admission of evidence under Section 3505, a lack of foreign certification of authenticity bars its admission entirely. Early appellate decisions upheld Section 3505 against Confrontation Clause challenges, citing Ohio v. Roberts in support of depositions. Crawford cast doubt on the broad application of the Roberts rule by requiring actual confrontation for testimonial hearsay, noting that most hearsay exceptions cover non-testimonial statements like business records. Despite this, many courts have dismissed Confrontation Clause challenges to Section 3505 based on the distinction between testimonial and non-testimonial statements.  The Constitution grants Congress broad extraterritorial powers, with few limitations on their exercise. States also possess residual authority and have enacted criminal laws that extend beyond U.S. territory. While prosecutions under such laws are infrequent due to practical, legal, and diplomatic challenges, they do occur.

Limitations on Jurisdiction to Prescribe: (1) Even when one basis for jurisdiction under §402 is present, a state may not exercise jurisdiction to prescribe law with respect to a person or activity having connections with another state if such exercise would be unreasonable.  The determination of whether exercising jurisdiction over a person or activity is unreasonable involves evaluating all relevant factors, including: (a) The link of the activity to the territory of the regulating state—specifically, the extent to which it takes place within the territory or has substantial, direct, and foreseeable effects there; (b) Connections between the regulating state and the person principally responsible for the regulated activity, such as nationality, residence, or economic activity, as well as connections between that state and those whom the regulation is designed to protect; (c) The character of the regulated activity, its importance to the regulating state, the extent to which other states regulate similar activities, and the general acceptance of the desirability of such regulation; (d) Justified expectations that might be protected or harmed by the regulation; (e) The significance of the regulation to the international political, legal, or economic system; (f) Consistency with traditions in the international system; (g) Another state’s interest in regulating the activity; and (h) The likelihood of conflict with another state's regulatory measures.  (2) When it is not unreasonable for both states to exercise jurisdiction over a person or activity but their prescriptions are in conflict, each state has an obligation to evaluate its own as well as the other state's interests in exercising jurisdiction, considering all relevant factors. A state should defer to the other if that state’s interest is clearly greater.  (3) §404
Jurisdiction to Adjudicate: A state may assert jurisdiction through its courts to adjudicate with respect to a person or a thing when such a relationship exists that makes the exercise of this jurisdiction reasonable.  In general, the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable if at the time it is asserted: - The person or thing is present in the state's territory on a non-transitory basis; - The person (a natural person) is domiciled within the state; - The person (a natural person) resides within the state; - The person (a natural person) is a national of the state; - The person (a corporation or comparable juridical person) is organized under the state's laws; - A ship, aircraft, or other vehicle involved in the adjudication is registered under the state’s laws; - The person, whether natural or juridical, has consented to the exercise of jurisdiction; - The person regularly conducts business within the state; - The person had conducted activities within the state, but only regarding those specific activities; - The person had engaged in an activity outside the state that has a substantial, direct, and foreseeable effect within the state, but only concerning such activity; or - The thing subject to adjudication is owned, possessed, or used within the state, but only for claims reasonably related to that thing.  A defense of lack of jurisdiction is generally waived by any appearance by or on behalf of a person or thing (whether as plaintiff, defendant, or third party) for purposes that do not include challenging the exercise of jurisdiction.

Since the formation of the modern U.S. intelligence community post-World War II, Congress and the executive branch have rarely disclosed the full extent of intelligence expenditures, with exceptions occurring only in two fiscal years during the 1990s. Intelligence programs and personnel have predominantly been integrated into the Defense Department (DOD) budget without explicit identification. This practice has long drawn criticism from advocates of transparency. The mid-1970s intelligence reform effort, which increased congressional involvement in overseeing the Intelligence Community, also produced several proposals to make intelligence spending public. Many believed that the end of the Cold War diminished the need for secrecy regarding overall intelligence budgets. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it was argued that few foreign entities could leverage information on U.S. intelligence spending trends to develop effective countermeasures. Terrorist organizations were deemed insufficiently equipped to exploit such data. Recently, proposals to disclose total intelligence spending have been reconsidered. In 1991 and 1992, legislation declared the "sense of Congress" that aggregate intelligence and related activity funding should be publicly disclosed in an appropriate manner. Despite this, both the House and Senate refrained from mandating the release of such data in subsequent years. During the Clinton Administration, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet twice attempted to disclose total figures for intelligence and related activities budgets, though no further disclosures were made after fiscal years 1997 and 1998. The issue remains relevant; the 9/11 Commission’s final report recommended that overall national intelligence appropriations, including those for component agencies, should no longer be kept secret.
Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, ensuring transparency in how tens of billions of dollars are allocated among various intelligence efforts. Several 2004 reform proposals included provisions for making the budget public, but these were not included in the ultimately enacted Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458). More recently, the FY2007 Intelligence Authorization legislation (S. 372), reported in January 2007, would require publication of budget totals for national intelligence programs but exclude tactical intelligence programs.  This report describes the components of the intelligence budget, past practices in handling authorizations and appropriations, arguments for and against public disclosure of intelligence spending, a legal analysis of these issues, and an examination of post-Cold War developments' implications on the question. It also details congressional interest in maintaining secrecy over intelligence spending totals.  The term "intelligence budget" is complex; it generally includes a wide array of agencies and functions within the Federal Government involved in intelligence collection, analysis, and dissemination but excludes certain information-gathering efforts like U.S. embassy reports to the State Department. Moreover, separate defense-related intelligence activities are included in overall intelligence spending categories.  For some purposes, intelligence and related activities can be defined as those authorized by annual intelligence authorization acts. Both the executive branch and Congress have sought a comprehensive overview of all intelligence collection systems and activities during annual budget reviews.
Thus, the concept of an intelligence community emerged, comprising various governmental entities such as the CIA, NSA, and smaller offices within departments like Treasury and Energy. Unlike a monolithic organization, this community includes components that are integral parts of agencies outside the Intelligence Community, with separate budget authorization processes. For instance, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research is both part of the Intelligence Community and an agency component. Its budget is considered in both the overall intelligence budget and as part of the State Department budget. Similar situations exist on a larger scale within the Defense Department.  Since these intelligence components are closely tied to their parent departments, it can be challenging to precisely segregate intelligence and non-intelligence costs. For this discussion, the U.S. "intelligence budget" encompasses activities authorized by the annual intelligence authorization acts, including:  1. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 2. The National Security Agency (NSA) 3. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) 4. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)  5. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) 6. Intelligence elements of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps 7. The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) 8. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 9. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 10. The Coast Guard 11. The Department of the Treasury 12. The Department of Energy 13. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)  The parameters defining the intelligence budget are somewhat arbitrary, as lines between intelligence and other information-gathering activities can be blurred. For example, while reporting by State Department Foreign Service Officers is a valuable adjunct to intelligence collection, it is not classified as an intelligence activity.
Similarly, certain reconnaissance and surveillance activities predominantly carried out within the Department of Defense (DOD) are closely related to intelligence operations but have not traditionally been classified as such due to administrative or historical reasons. The U.S. Congress authorizes the intelligence budget into two main components: the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). NIP programs, previously known as the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP), focus on national-level decision making and are conducted by agencies such as the CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, NGA, and others in Washington. MIP programs support defense policymaking and military operations worldwide through various DOD agencies.  Before September 2005, DOD had two distinct sets of programs: the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) and Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA). JMIP, established in 1994 to support broader DOD activities, included initiatives aimed at joint intelligence efforts. TIARA encompassed a range of reconnaissance and target acquisition programs integrated into military operations.  Recent years have seen increased overlap between intelligence and related activities, such as the immediate availability of satellite imagery to tactical commanders. Consequently, JMIP and TIARA were merged into MIP in September 2005. Within this framework, both former JMIP and TIARA programs now support DOD-wide intelligence efforts and military operations.  The relationship between intelligence-related and regular intelligence programs is complex and often not fully understood by the public. In 1994, DCI R. James Woolsey described them as a "loose amalgamation of activities" that could vary yearly based on how each military service defined tactical intelligence. These related programs can account for about a third of total intelligence spending and are integral to defense programs, often supported by non-intelligence personnel and facilities.
The administrative expenses of a military base with both intelligence and non-intelligence functions, such as an intelligence-related mission, are typically not included in intelligence accounts. Public discussions often misinterpret the role of intelligence programs within the multi-billion dollar intelligence effort. Following the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has broad statutory authority to develop and determine the National Intelligence Program (NIP), which is then submitted to the President for approval. The President subsequently forwards this program to Congress as part of the annual budget submission in January or February. The Office of the DNI (ODNI) assists the DNI in preparing and submitting the annual budget. The DNI also participates in the development of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) with the Secretary of Defense. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) oversees all defense intelligence budgetary matters to ensure compliance with the NIP budget policies issued by the DNI. Additionally, the USD(I) acts as the Program Executive for the MIP and coordinates during programming, budgeting, and execution cycles. Thus, both the ODNI and the office of the USD(I) play essential roles in developing both the NIP and the MIP, with overlapping responsibilities that require close coordination.  Budgeting for secret intelligence efforts has long posed significant challenges to Congress. To address the need for some direction over an intelligence effort disbanded after World War II, President Truman established the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) on January 22, 1946, through a directive. The CIG was a coordinative group comprising representatives from the State, War, and Navy Departments, without creating a new agency. Personnel and facilities were to be provided within existing limits of available appropriations. However, concerns arose regarding the legal requirement for specific Congressional authorization to make funds available to any agency in existence more than a year, leading to questions about this arrangement.
Thus, it might have been illegal for the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) to spend funds after January 22, 1947. Shortly after assuming office in June 1946, the second Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, arranged for a "working fund" consisting of allotments from the Departments of State, War, and Navy, supervised by the Comptroller General, to cover CIG expenses. It is unclear whether funds were transferred from all three departments; the larger budgets of the War and Navy Departments likely made them more probable contributors than the State Department. Recognizing this administrative weakness, Vandenberg initiated efforts to gain congressional approval for an independent intelligence agency with its own budget. The National Security Act of 1947 established a unified National Defense Establishment and included provisions for a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), headed by a Director of Central Intelligence. It also authorized the transfer of "personnel, property, and records" from the CIG to the new CIA; however, it did not provide specific statutory language regarding the administration of the CIA.  Following the creation of the CIA under the National Security Act of 1947, arrangements were made to continue previous funding mechanisms. The Agency was directed to follow normal procedures until Congress enacted further legislation addressing its unique needs. It was acknowledged that additional enabling legislation would be necessary. After some delays, Congress passed the Central Intelligence Act of 1949 (P.L. 81-110) to provide a firmer statutory basis for the CIA and to establish regular appropriation procedures. This act gave the CIA authority to transfer sums approved by the Bureau of the Budget (the predecessor of today's Office of Management and Budget) to and from other government agencies. The 1949 Act also stipulated that "sums transferred to the [CIA]...
According to Representative Carl Vinson's statement on the House floor following the 1949 Act's passage, the legislation granted the authority to transfer sums from other government agencies, as approved by the Bureau of the Budget, for performing agency functions. This is how the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) secures its funding; this practice has been ongoing since the CIA’s creation and merely formalizes an essential function necessary to conceal the exact amount required for operating an efficient intelligence service.  The 1949 Act provides CIA funding through the defense authorization and appropriation process, with other intelligence activities of Department of Defense (DOD) agencies logically included in defense bills. For years, authorizations and appropriations for the CIA were managed by a small number of Members and staff from the two appropriations committees, often consulting members of the armed services committees. Senior Appropriations Committee Members insisted on maintaining the confidentiality of the CIA's budget requests and related congressional actions.  In 1956, subcommittees were established in both Houses' Armed Services and Appropriations Committees to oversee the CIA. Assessments of congressional oversight during the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson Administrations suggest a largely supportive but perfunctory role. However, there is substantial evidence indicating that Congress paid close attention to intelligence spending, particularly major surveillance systems and headquarters construction.  The handful of Members responsible for overseeing intelligence had a collaborative relationship with the CIA.
From the Eisenhower Administration onwards, Senator Richard Russell served as both chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations, significantly influencing intelligence spending during the Cold War years. As a result, intelligence budgets expanded substantially, largely due to efforts to ascertain Soviet nuclear capabilities through overhead surveillance by aircraft like U-2s and reconnaissance satellites, along with extensive signals intelligence operations. This period saw the emergence of major agencies such as NSA and DIA, which received large budgets, while other organizations were established to deploy satellites and interpret aerial photography. These initiatives directly contributed to the design of strategic weapons systems and negotiations of arms control agreements with the Soviet Union, costing billions of dollars. Initiated by Congress, these programs were executed in secrecy involving multiple intelligence agencies and Defense Department components.  President Lyndon Johnson, on March 16, 1967, commented: "I wouldn't want to be quoted on this but we've spent 35 or 40 billion dollars on the space program. And if nothing else had come out of it except the knowledge we've gained from space photography, it would be worth ten times what the whole program has cost. Because tonight we know how many missiles the enemy has and, as it turned out, our guesses were way off. We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor. Because of satellites, I know exactly how many missiles the enemy has."  During the Ford Administration, Executive Order 11905, issued on February 18, 1975, consolidated intelligence agency budgets and mandated a comprehensive review of the National Foreign Intelligence Program by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and senior officials from Defense and National Security Council. Subsequent executive orders, notably E.O. 12333 of December 4, 1981, and the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY1993 (P.L. 102-496), further clarified and strengthened the DCI's role. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L.
The authority to coordinate intelligence activities across the government and manage the National Intelligence Program (NIP) was granted to the newly established position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The DNI is responsible for developing and determining the annual consolidated NIP budget, and also participates in the development of the Military Intelligence Program (MIP), which falls under the Secretary of Defense's purview. The increasing detailed oversight by Congress has been a key factor encouraging a more consolidated review of the intelligence budget.  Efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to establish intelligence committees or involve a larger number of members in oversight were rejected, leaving oversight primarily in the hands of a few senior legislators. The situation changed after the Vietnam War due to several revelations about alleged illegal and improper activities by intelligence agencies in 1975. In response, Congress created two temporary select committees—the Church and Pike Committees—to investigate the CIA and other intelligence agencies.  These committees conducted extensive investigations into various intelligence issues and held well-publicized hearings. Although budgetary concerns were not their primary focus, a consensus emerged that congressional oversight of intelligence agencies needed to be strengthened and formalized, leading to the establishment of permanent intelligence committees. There was also a general sentiment that more information about these agencies and their activities should be made public.  Following the work of the Church and Pike Committees, Congress took steps to revamp oversight of intelligence agencies by establishing the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) in 1976 and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in 1977. Both committees were given oversight over the CIA and other intelligence agencies, tasked with preventing the types of abuses highlighted during the Church and Pike Committees' investigations.  A crucial difference between these two committees is their mandate regarding budgetary matters: while HPSCI has oversight of the NIP and shares joint oversight of the MIP with the Armed Services Committee, SSCI has sole responsibility for overseeing the NIP.
In the Senate, oversight of the Multi-Intelligence Program (MIP) is handled by the Armed Services Committee, with informal consultations from the Intelligence Committee. Both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and the Senate Armed Services Committee participate in conferences regarding intelligence authorization bills. The final bill, as reported by the conference committee, authorizes both intelligence activities and related operations.  While the two intelligence committees are not solely responsible for congressional oversight, the Armed Services Committees often issue sequential reports on intelligence authorization bills. Annual defense authorization acts encompass large national intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense (DOD) and the intelligence efforts of the four services. Intelligence activities outside the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and DOD are authorized by other legislation, with some departments having standing authorizations rather than annual authorization acts.  Like other congressional committees, oversight of intelligence involves reviewing the administration's annual budget proposals for the Intelligence Community, conducting hearings, preparing an annual authorization bill, and managing it within their respective chambers. The two intelligence committees publish reports to accompany these bills, which include detailed dollar amounts for various intelligence agencies in classified annexes. These annexes are accessible only to members of Congress within intelligence committee offices, with strict sanctions for unauthorized disclosure.  However, the intelligence committees do not have exclusive jurisdiction over all intelligence expenditures. National defense authorization acts also contain authorizing legislation for intelligence activities funded through these bills. Certain parts of defense authorization bills remain classified and can cover "black" programs, including both intelligence operations and procurement of new weapons systems like stealth aircraft. Members can obtain information about the classified sections from the Armed Services Committees.  Other authorization bills provide forms of shared oversight over some intelligence activities. Budgets for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are included in appropriation bills covering the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State. Similar procedures apply to intelligence entities within the Treasury and Energy Department, funded through appropriations bills for the Departments of Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government, as well as Energy and Water Development.
All these combined represent only a small percentage of total intelligence spending; for example, the FY2007 budget request for INR was just $51 million, and other agencies are even smaller. There has been some controversy over the nature of the authorizing legislation required. Section 504(a) of the National Security Act stipulates that appropriated funds may be obligated or expended only if they were specifically authorized by Congress for such activities. However, the term "specific authorization" had not been defined. On November 30, 1990, President George H.W. Bush pocket vetoed the FY1991 Intelligence Authorization bill when it was presented to him after the 101st Congress had adjourned. This resulted in intelligence activities continuing for over eight months without an authorization act. While some believed that authorizations within the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1991 (P.L. 101-510) were sufficient, the House Intelligence Committee stated that only an intelligence authorization bill provides the necessary specificity to comply with Section 504(a). In 1993, the House report accompanying the FY1994 Defense Authorization Act included language indicating that the Armed Services Committee did not consider inclusion of NFIP program authorizations as a specific authorization required by section 504 of the National Security Act. Furthermore, Section 309 of the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 103-178) amended the National Security Act to explicitly state that the general authorization in the 1947 legislation does not satisfy the requirement for specific authorization. In some years when appropriations have been passed before final action on authorization bills, similar provisions to section 8092 of the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L.
Funds appropriated by this Act or transferred through this Act for intelligence activities are deemed specifically authorized by Congress under section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 414) during fiscal year 2006 until the enactment of the Intelligence Authorization Act for that same fiscal year. Since no FY2006 intelligence authorization bill was passed, this clause in the appropriations bill provided the necessary authorization. Similarly, the FY2007 defense appropriations bill (P.L. 109-289, section 8083) included a similar clause before an intelligence authorization bill for that fiscal year could be considered on the floor. Although no intelligence authorization legislation was enacted in the 109th Congress, S. 372, an intelligence authorization bill for FY2007, was reported by the Senate in January 2007.  These provisions satisfy the statutory requirement for specific authorization but offer significantly less guidance to intelligence programs than traditional annual authorizations. As with all government activities, appropriations committees play a central role in intelligence programs. Even during the Cold War, when public oversight of intelligence activities received little attention, Congress required annual appropriations and held extensive hearings. In recent years, these committees have increasingly influenced the conduct of intelligence operations. For instance, in 1998, P.L. 105-277 added substantial funds for intelligence efforts not included in the annual authorization bill. Post-9/11, reliance on supplemental appropriations to fund regular intelligence agency operations has limited congressional oversight over the intelligence budget.  This practice of using supplemental appropriations has been widely criticized; the House Intelligence Committee noted in 2003 that while such funding reflected crises following terrorist attacks, "The repeated use of supplemental appropriations has an erosive and negative effect on long-term planning."
The Committee expects that the IC has reached a stable resource and capability plateau, allowing for long-term strategic planning. In FY2006, the necessary "specific authorization" for intelligence programs under Section 504 of the National Security Act was provided by one paragraph (Section 8092) of the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-148). This reliance on appropriations measures to authorize intelligence programs may alter congressional oversight by highlighting the role of the two appropriations committees.  The defense subcommittees of these committees review intelligence budget requests and approve funding levels for agencies within DOD or those included in defense appropriation acts, such as the CIA, NSA, DIA, NRO, and NGA. The CIA and ODNI's budgets, though part of defense appropriations, are transferred directly to the DNI and CIA Director by the OMB without DOD involvement. In contrast, the Secretary of Defense plays a significant role in intelligence agencies within DOD.  The CIA and defense agencies account for the majority of intelligence spending. Smaller amounts are found in appropriation measures for other departments that contain elements of the Intelligence Community.  The appropriations committees can significantly influence these budgets. For instance, in 1992, the FY1993 Defense Appropriation Act (P.L. 102-396) reportedly reduced intelligence spending below the level authorized by the Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 102-496). In 1990-1991, the Senate Appropriations Committee and SSCI collaborated closely to sponsor a facilities consolidation plan for CIA activities without HPSCI involvement.  Since World War II, intelligence budgets have not been publicly disclosed.
At the end of hostilities in August 1945, intelligence operations were transitioned from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to the Army, Navy, and State Departments, which took on financial responsibility. The establishment of the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) in 1946 necessitated the creation of a "working fund," as noted earlier, funded by allocations from these three departments. This pattern continued when the CIA was established the following year, though there might have been few or no transfers from the State Department. Appropriated funds were transferred secretly, reportedly at Congress's insistence. Several parts of the intelligence budget are publicly disclosed: the costs of the Intelligence Community Management Account (CMA) and the CIA Retirement and Disability System (CIARDS). The CMA includes staff support for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), while CIARDS covers retirement benefits for CIA personnel not eligible for the government-wide system. For FY2005, $310.4 million was authorized for 310 full-time CMA personnel and $239.4 million was allocated to CIARDS.  Additionally, the budget of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research is publicly disclosed, with some but not all tactical intelligence programs identified in unclassified DOD budget submissions. Officially published data on intelligence expenditures do not provide a comprehensive picture of the intelligence budget’s size and content. Both the Church and Pike committees advocated for public disclosure of each annual intelligence budget. The then-DCI, George H.W. Bush, and President Ford appealed to the Senate against disclosure, with the question ultimately referred to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI). In May 1977 (S.Res. 207, 95th Congress), SSCI recommended that aggregate amounts appropriated for national foreign intelligence activities in FY1978 be disclosed. However, the full Senate did not act on this recommendation.  The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), established after the termination of the Pike Committee by House Rule XLVIII, conducted an extensive study on disclosure issues.
Following hearings in 1978, despite DCI Stansfield Turner’s willingness to disclose "a single inclusive budget figure," the House Committee unanimously concluded that there was no persuasive reason for disclosing any or all amounts of intelligence and intelligence-related funds authorized by the government. Without action from either chamber, the disclosure issue receded into the background. During the Carter Administration, efforts were made to draft a legislative charter for the Intelligence Community but ultimately proved unsuccessful. The Reagan Administration showed less interest in such questions as it expanded intelligence activities significantly. This issue resurfaced during the Clinton Administration post-Cold War and was also highlighted in the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.  Since the establishment of the two intelligence committees in the 1970s, Members have been able to review budget figures contained within classified annexes of intelligence authorization bills, though rules prevent the divulgence of such information. Arguments for and against public disclosure of intelligence spending levels continue to center on constitutional issues regarding full reports of government expenditures, as well as broader questions about the value of open political discourse, potential dangers of revealing useful information to adversaries, and difficulties in providing aggregate numbers without disclosing details.  Advocates of disclosure argue that greater public discussion of intelligence spending could lead to a stronger intelligence effort. They assert that no organization, regardless of management quality or personnel, is immune from waste and inefficiency. Increased awareness of costs and benefits might ultimately improve the organization and functioning of intelligence. Senator William Proxmire succinctly argued: "People not only have a right to know, but they will have a much more efficient government when they do."
We make improvements only when we receive criticism, and you can offer constructive criticism only if you possess relevant knowledge or information. For instance, if you are aware of the amount spent on intelligence, you will be better positioned to critique how this expenditure is utilized. Moreover, publishing an aggregate figure for intelligence spending could lead to a cleaner and more accurate defense budget. Currently, the defense budget includes significant unspecified national intelligence expenditures, such as much of the CIA’s budget, which may not always align with defense-specific spending. These undisclosed expenses can make the overall defense budget appear larger than it is. Identifying intelligence expenditures that are unrelated to defense could provide a clearer picture of actual defense costs.  Those advocating for this approach argue that revealing limited intelligence spending totals would offer no strategic advantage to adversaries. Even during the Cold War, Soviet authorities likely had a good understanding of the U.S. intelligence budget, and their focus was more on our activities than the size of our expenditures. In 1994, Representative Dan Glickman, then Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stated, "Unless there is a national security justification, keeping budget totals secret serves only to prevent taxpayers from knowing how much money is spent on intelligence."  Opponents argue that intelligence operations are inherently distinct from other government activities and that disclosing general budgetary information could expose sensitive capabilities and operations to adversaries. This perspective views intelligence as an exceptional activity not amenable to the normal procedures of open societies, especially in terms of collecting intelligence.
Sophisticated reconnaissance devices, electronic technology, and human resources operating under significant risk are particularly vulnerable to both human error and hostile penetration; thus, they require exceptional protective measures. In 1983, HPSCI highlighted the unique vulnerabilities of intelligence systems, noting that intelligence activities and capabilities are inherently fragile. Unlike weapons systems, which can only be countered by more sophisticated development over a long period, intelligence systems can be compromised immediately based on their mere existence. For instance, disclosing budget information might disproportionately benefit adversaries who could then use this knowledge to thwart U.S. intelligence missions.  At the end of the Cold War and with the downsizing of defense budgets, there was an argument for significantly reducing intelligence spending. Some advocated that publishing these figures would lead the public to perceive such expenditures as unjustified and thus reduce them. This concern was shared by those defending intelligence spending levels, who feared public opposition to transparency.  In the early 1990s, this perspective may have been widely held; however, later in the decade, concerns about international terrorism and other transnational threats prompted a reassessment of these views. The September 11 attacks significantly altered the climate regarding intelligence spending, with widespread criticism of intelligence agency performance leading to a determination that whatever was necessary should be spent on intelligence as part of the global war on terrorism.  In recent years, arguments for making intelligence spending levels public have generally not been used as a proxy for reducing such spending. Few would argue that less intelligence is needed given the realistic potential for more Al Qaeda attacks. Some opponents maintain that disclosing just budget figures will be meaningless in the broader public debate.
Explanations will be necessary to clarify how these figures are distributed among various functions, threats, and agencies, and whether they encompass national and tactical programs, potentially including administrative and logistical support. In a politically contentious environment, there would be increasing pressure to disclose both sub-totals and the aggregated figure. It is argued that such transparency could lead adversaries to develop effective countermeasures against U.S. intelligence activities.  Alternatively, it could be more beneficial to express intelligence spending as a percentage of overall defense spending, even within the National Intelligence Program (NIP). Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who served as Deputy Director of Central Intelligence during the early Reagan Administration, stated in 1991 that "I am prepared to make unclassified the total amount and defend publicly why 10% of our total defense efforts spent on both national and tactical intelligence is a reasonable goal." He also noted that just as 11 or 12% of the budget for research and development is acceptable, so too could be this percentage for intelligence spending.  Opponents argue that disclosing intelligence spending figures might reveal new programs under development, such as U-2s and satellites. Premature disclosure could compromise their effectiveness by alerting adversaries to emerging capabilities before they can be fully utilized. However, a 1991 Senate report noted that DCI Stansfield Turner testified in 1977 that there were no significant "bumps" in the intelligence budget for the previous decade. The Select Committee’s experience since then supports this view, suggesting that publishing annual totals would not compromise national security.  Despite these arguments, some analysts argue that revealing significant year-to-year changes in U.S. intelligence budgets could alert unfriendly governments to new initiatives against them or to a reduction in U.S. efforts.
The discussion on making intelligence budgets public typically centers around constitutional and propriety concerns regarding classified spending figures. However, a less explored issue is the nature of intelligence and related expenditures. The National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Military Intelligence Program (MIP) have been publicly acknowledged in various Executive and Legislative Branch documents, but their specific roles are not well understood outside a narrow circle of intelligence specialists. In particular, the role of tactical programs often goes unconsidered when debating public disclosure of spending levels.  There is concern that categorizing certain projects as part of a tactical intelligence program could be seen as arbitrary if similar projects are included in other Defense budget categories. Additionally, there has been inconsistent inclusion of some projects within the MIP over the years, leading to potential confusion in tracking intelligence spending. Some proposals suggest making public only the NIP budget, which includes funding for the CIA, National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA; formerly NIMA), and National Security Agency (NSA).  In 2002, the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) was established by Section 901 of the FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 107-314). This role aims to better integrate intelligence functions within the Department of Defense structure.
The current incumbent, Stephen Cambone, is responsible for overseeing the budgets of DOD's intelligence agencies, including both National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Military Intelligence Program (MIP) components. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) serves as the key point of contact between DOD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Together, they collaborate on preparing annual budget submissions to Congress along with other intelligence agencies.  The issue of disclosing an aggregate intelligence budget figure arises from whether the Statement and Account Clause in the United States Constitution mandates such disclosure. This clause is found in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7: "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time."   A brief examination of the historical context and limited case law interpreting this clause may help place the disclosure issue in perspective. During the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, George Mason proposed an amendment requiring "an Account of the public expenditures should be annually published" on September 14, 1787. Debate ensued; for instance, Governor Morris argued that such frequent publication would be impractical in many cases, while James Madison suggested changing "annually" to "from time to time," allowing for more discretion in publication frequency and ensuring regularity rather than requiring infrequent compliance.
During the Virginia ratifying convention, the Statement and Account Clause was discussed on at least two occasions. On June 12, 1788, James Madison noted that congressional proceedings would be published "from time to time," including all receipts and expenditures of public money, none of which could be used without prior law. This provided a security not present in the existing system. He acknowledged the clause's allowance for secrecy, citing it as an imitation from the Articles of Confederation.  On June 17, 1788, George Mason raised concerns about the phrase "from time to time," arguing that it was too vague and could be interpreted as allowing for perpetual secrecy on public matters. He emphasized that while military operations and foreign negotiations might require confidentiality, public expenditures should always remain transparent. Mason concluded that this phrase was excessively ambiguous and potentially harmful.  In a subsequent vote, the amended motion supported by Col. Mason—stating that "appropriations by law" would be followed by "a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time"—was agreed upon.
Lee (of Westmoreland) believed that arguments of such trivial nature as those recently presented by the honorable gentleman would hold no weight with the committee. He considered the expression to be sufficiently clear and satisfactory, implying short, convenient periods, akin to one year or a shorter term. Those who neglected this provision would disregard the most explicit instructions.  Mr. Mason respectfully requested permission to employ his accustomed method of argumentation. While he was eager to please that gentleman, his duty must not yield to personal desire.  Mr. George Nicholas argued that this directive provided a better safeguard than any in the state government. As no public money could be appropriated without legislative approval, there would be no risk of misapplication. He deemed it meritorious rather than censurable, as a cautious provision adopted by few, if any, constitutions.  Mr. Corbin concurred with Mr. Nicholas's sentiments on this matter.  Mr. Madison believed that the clause was superior to specifying any particular period. He argued that publishing accounts at regular but unspecified intervals would provide more detailed and continuous information, facilitating detection of errors. This approach offered a balance between frequency and comprehensiveness, surpassing existing state constitutions, if not those worldwide.  Mr. Mason responded by noting that under the Confederation, public proceedings were published monthly, far preferable to relying on individual discretion for disclosure.
Gentlemen, if there were no such provision in the Virginia Constitution, we should consider the difference between a full representation that is dispersed and mingled with every part of the community, like the state representation, and an inadequate representation as this one. The former might be trusted safely, but not the latter.  Mr. Madison responded that the inconveniences experienced from the Confederation in this regard weighed heavily on him, leading him to recommend this form over the other. He noted that it was impossible to satisfactorily adjust public accounts within such short intervals without such a provision.  Mr. Henry, Chairman, stated that we have now reached the 9th section and should consider it briefly. There is a bill of rights in this government, but its express restrictions are actually found in the form of the 9th section. The intent of the negative expressions here is to set clear limits beyond which Congress cannot go. These bounds are the sole intentions of the American government.  Examining this congressional bill of rights, we find that the restraints it contains are so feeble and few that it would have been far better to say nothing about them. The fair implication is that Congress can do everything not explicitly forbidden by the Constitution. If Congress, in its legislation, should do something not restrained by the 9th section, it would fall as an incidental power.  If Virginia’s government passes a law contradicting our bill of rights, such a law would be ineffective.
By that paper, national wealth is to be managed under the guise of secrecy, as its publication will amount to nothing, allowing them to conceal what they deem necessary. In contrast, in your own government, the journals of our legislature are published daily during every session, and the lobby is filled with people each day. Yet, gentlemen argue that this periodic publication offers a security absent from our state government! Such a regulation would be ineffective or unnecessary since the public already sees our legislative journals and hears debates daily. If this does not offer more security than what’s proposed in that paper, I must concede that I have misunderstood the principles of the government.  You are assured that your rights are secured in this new government, but they are safeguarded only in the 9th section. The few restrictions in that section are your sole protection. These may control your actions and words without contradicting that document. Your most cherished privileges will depend on Congress's consent, as they are not covered by the 9th section.  This clause was also discussed in the New York ratifying convention and the Maryland House of Delegates. In the June 27, 1788, debates, Mr. Chancellor Livingston addressed concerns about taxation power, stating: “You will relinquish everything precious to your state legislatures; but you grant no power to Congress because it might be abused; you withhold revenue from them because the public funds might be squandered. But do you not see a key check here? Congress are required to publish their receipts and expenditures periodically.”
These financial records can be compared year after year; if the former consistently exceed the latter, corruption would be revealed, and constitutional remedies could be sought by the people. I urge the committee to consider that "from time to time" in the Constitution means regular intervals, not necessarily long periods like centuries or decades.  Honorable Mr. Smith noted that "from time to time" could refer to any interval, even as short as a few years. The Chancellor questioned whether public scrutiny of government spending was more fervently desired than anything else. He surmised that representatives would find it essential to their popularity to provide frequent and detailed statements of the public accounts, which is beyond doubt.  On November 29, 1787, delegates from the Constitutional Convention appeared before the Maryland House of Delegates to explain the principles behind the proposed Constitution. James McHenry explained Section 9, stating that public funds should be disbursed only through legislative appropriation, a provision expected to face no opposition since taxpayers have the right to know how their money is spent.  This historical context highlights various viewpoints on anticipated benefits and the intended scope of such language, though it did not extensively address potential secrecy in funding intelligence operations. The main focus was on the necessity of this provision, the timing of public statements, and its practical implications. However, some delegates acknowledged the possibility of secrecy attached to certain accounts. For instance, Mr. Wilson's remarks during the Constitutional Convention can be compared with those made by Mr. Mason at the Virginia ratifying convention.
Wilson observed that certain financial operations could not be disclosed at specific times. Mr. Mason acknowledged that sometimes military or foreign affairs required secrecy, yet he rejected the idea that public funds' receipts and expenditures should ever remain concealed. The most explicit reference to such secrecy is in Mr. McHenry's remarks, where he argued that the clause's requirement of periodic publication was broad enough to allow Congress to manage public wealth in secret or conceal information deemed necessary. While his perspective on this issue was uncertain among others, it appears clear that concerns about how public funds would be spent drove the inclusion of the Statement and Account Clause.  The clause seems to impose a duty to disclose public receipts and expenditures, yet general outlines do not provide clear guidance on the scope and frequency of these disclosures. There are hints suggesting that some at the Constitutional Convention and ratifying conventions anticipated delays in releasing information or possibly its secrecy with varying reactions. Further insight can be gleaned from judicial interpretations of the clause within an intelligence budget context. Notably, in 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Richardson (418 U.S. 166) that a federal taxpayer's challenge to the CIA Act's provisions was unsuccessful, as these permitted CIA expenditures reporting based solely on the Director’s certificate. Despite Richardson's repeated requests for detailed information from government offices, he found the provided details unsatisfactory.
He contested the constitutionality of a particular provision and asked the Treasury Department to seek an opinion from the Attorney General on its legality. When the department declined, he filed a lawsuit. The district court dismissed his case for lack of standing and on the ground that the issue was a political question not suitable for judicial resolution. His request for a three-judge panel was also denied by the district court. The Third Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed this decision, directing the case to be heard by a three-judge panel. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and ultimately reversed the lower courts' decisions. The central issue before the Supreme Court was whether the respondent had standing to bring the lawsuit. Without addressing the constitutional merits, the Court ruled that he lacked standing. In its decision, the Court noted that if the respondent were not allowed to litigate this matter, no one might be able to do so. This absence of specific individuals or classes to challenge such issues could imply that these matters are primarily within Congress's purview and political processes.  In a footnote, the Court observed that while it did not need to define "a regular Statement and Account" precisely, it was clear that Congress has broad authority to require any reporting it deems necessary for the public interest. The Court questioned whether the framers of the Constitution envisioned general directives to the Congress or Executive being enforceable by an individual citizen. Historical analysis suggested that cl. 7 might have been intended to allow some degree of secrecy in government operations, with the ultimate enforcement power lying with the "power of the purse." Regardless of this statute, Congress could grant standing to taxpayers or citizens, constrained by the “cases” and “controversies” provision of Article III.
III. Nearly two centuries of judicial acceptance have recognized that Congress retains plenary power under Article I, section 9, clause 7 to detail when and in what specific manner executive agencies must report on the expenditure of appropriated funds, while also exempting certain secret activities from comprehensive public reporting. This understanding is reflected in historical records such as Farrand’s Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, Elliot’s Debates on the Federal Constitution, and Miller’s Secret Statutes of the United States.  Notably, several lower court decisions further illuminate this principle. In Harrington v. Bush (553 F.2d 190, D.C. Cir., 1977), a Member of Congress attempted to prevent the CIA from using funding and reporting provisions under the 1949 Central Intelligence Act related to allegedly illegal activities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit due to lack of standing. Although the plaintiff did not contest the constitutional validity of these provisions, the court emphasized that the funding and reporting requirements for the CIA represent an exception to general federal spending procedures.  The court also noted that Article I, section 9, clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution is not self-explanatory, granting Congress extensive authority to define its meaning through statutory implementation. Specifically, the key statutory provision addressing expenditures is 31 U.S.C. § 1029, which mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to submit an annual report detailing all public financial transactions to Congress.  Given Congress’s broad discretion in shaping the appropriations and reporting processes, it has the authority to create exceptions for particular agencies like the CIA.
CIA v. 629 F.2d 144 (D.C. Cir. 1980) involved a private citizen's request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, for CIA documents related to legal bills and fee arrangements with private attorneys retained by the Agency. These documents were ruled exempt from disclosure under FOIA’s exception 3, which covers statutory exemptions. Judge Gasch concluded that the documents were protected under both 50 U.S.C. § 403(d)(3) (1976), which shields intelligence sources and methods, and Section 6 of the Central Intelligence Act, 50 U.S.C. § 403g (1976). The plaintiff contended that applying these statutes violated the Statement and Account Clause. However, the appellate court, referencing United States v. Richardson, dismissed this argument by noting the lack of standing to challenge secret CIA appropriations and expenditures due to the absence of a particular concrete injury.   In reviewing the constitutional validity and justiciability of statutory secrecy for CIA expenditures, the Halperin court examined the historical context of the Statement and Account Clause. The court analyzed Mason's statements during the Virginia ratifying convention in June 1788, which revealed several key points: first, Madison’s support for maintaining some governmental expenditures’ secrecy was not an isolated viewpoint but reflective of his fellow proponents; second, military operations and foreign negotiations were cited as areas requiring potential secrecy; third, opponents like Mason favored secrecy only for the actual operations and negotiations, not for public money associated with them.
The Statement and Account Clause, as adopted and ratified, reflects the perspective of Mason's opponents, who advocated for discretionary secrecy regarding both expenditures and related operations. The court interpreted Patrick Henry’s concern about the "from time to time" language as confirmation that the Framers intended the clause to allow Congress and the President discretion to maintain such secrecy for military operations and foreign negotiations. There is no evidence from proponents of the Statement and Account Clause indicating a desire for mandatory disclosure.  The Halperin court also found support in historical practices, both before and after the Constitution’s adoption, that government entities had used discretion regarding financial disclosures and maintaining secrecy. The Continental Congress established the Committee of Secret Correspondence on November 29, 1775, to manage expenses related to sending agents. When this committee received intelligence from Arthur Lee about French plans to supply arms and ammunition to the Continental Army, it kept this information secret, even from Congress, due to its critical nature.  Additionally, George Washington, as commander-in-chief of the colonial armies, employed similar strategies in concealing the intended use and recipients of intelligence funds. A letter from Robert Morris, a member of the Committee of Secret Correspondence, dated January 21, 1783, illustrates this practice.
The letter highlights the provision of a cash account intended to cover potential future needs for contingencies and secret service activities. Drafts from this account were drawn in favor of members of Washington's family associated with secret services, likely to obscure the true recipients' identities. The court also mentioned several statutes establishing contingent funds or secret service funds, allowing the President to allocate secret funding for foreign intelligence operations. For instance, the Act of July 1, 1790 (1 Stat. 128), allocated money to "persons serving the United States in foreign parts" and required regular accounting but permitted undisclosed expenditures if deemed necessary. The Act of February 9, 1793 (1 Stat. 299, 300) amended this statute to allow the President to make secret payments by certificate or through the Secretary of State, without specifying amounts. While specific details were not required to be disclosed, aggregate numbers for these fund appropriations were recorded. In Aftergood v. Central Intelligence Agency (355 F. Supp. 2d 557, D.D.C., 2005), the plaintiff sought historical intelligence budget information from 1947 to 1970, as well as agency budget totals, from the CIA under FOIA. The CIA refused disclosure, citing exemption 3, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3), based on 50 U.S.C. § 403-3(c)(7), which protects intelligence sources and methods. The court ruled in favor of the CIA, rejecting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, with the plaintiff arguing that the Statement and Account Clause mandated disclosure.
In the Halperin case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which relied on Richardson, upheld Judge Urbina's rejection of plaintiff Aftergood's argument that a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of CIA budget secrecy under the Statement and Account Clause. This clause is understood to obligate Congress to periodically provide an account and statement regarding the disposition of public funds. While debates during the Constitutional Convention and ratifying conventions largely focused on the timing and scope, they hinted that some degree of secrecy might be expected in military and foreign affairs matters. Historically, both before and after the Constitution's adoption, provisions were enacted or practiced to safeguard intelligence information and activities, as well as funding details for such activities. Early statutes created funds with aggregate figures but allowed for limited documentation. Judicial interpretations suggest that Congress holds the power to define the scope of the Statement and Account Clause language. Courts have consistently denied standing to challenge the CIA's 1949 Act secrecy provisions under this clause, particularly in attempts to access undisclosed information.
The Richardson Court and subsequent cases have established that Congress holds full authority to define the scope of the Clause's language and mandate specific expenditure reports deemed beneficial to the public interest. This authority is typically exercised through statutory mandates. Courts suggest that secrecy regarding certain expenditures, particularly those related to foreign or military matters, was likely anticipated during the drafting of the clause and reflected in historical practices.  Since the nation's early years, Congress has, by statute, established funds for foreign intelligence activities and allowed these funds to be disbursed via certificates. While many statutes do specify total amounts for such secret funds, they often do not require detailed reporting on specific expenditures. The 1949 Central Intelligence Agency Act permits transferring funds from other agencies for intelligence purposes, aiding in the concealment of actual funding levels.  There seems to have been some ambiguity among the Constitution's framers regarding the extent of Congress's obligation under the Clause. Given the constitutional language, its history, and limited judicial interpretation, courts generally view Congress as having the power to determine the meaning of the clause. While courts have not directly addressed this issue on its merits, they might avoid it if presented on political question grounds. However, current judicial interpretations suggest that a court would likely find no constitutional requirement for disclosing aggregate intelligence budgets.  The end of the Cold War significantly impacted intelligence spending. With the absence of a formidable enemy and its own intelligence services, substantial reductions in intelligence funding were implemented, leading to renewed debates about the necessity of budgetary secrecy.
In November 1993, Senator Robert Kerrey asserted: "Openness is now the norm, and unless a threat as significant and dangerous as the old Soviet Union emerges, our society and government will continue to grow more transparent. Our goal must be to make intelligence more accessible to the American public, not to hoard it." Some argued that the perceived failures of intelligence agencies in understanding the vulnerability of the Soviet system or in collecting information on Iraqi nuclear capabilities necessitate substantial reforms and reductions in collection and analytical efforts.  Across-the-board cuts in defense spending impacted intelligence funding in two ways. Firstly, it was assumed that a smaller military would reduce the need for an extensive intelligence infrastructure; fewer troops might require less support personnel. However, some counter-argued that leaner force structures actually necessitated stronger intelligence support to ensure their most effective use. Secondly, as much of the intelligence budget remained "hidden" within the Department of Defense (DOD) budget, defense spending reductions required either proportional cuts in intelligence programs or disproportionately larger reductions in non-intelligence areas to maintain existing intelligence funding levels. The latter alternative faced significant resistance from defense planners who were already grappling with maintaining other high-priority programs.  This debate over future intelligence program requirements was connected but distinct from the ongoing controversy regarding public disclosure of intelligence spending. Those opposed to current or increased intelligence spending feared that revealing its high costs might lead to calls for drastic reductions. Efforts to reduce funding in intelligence authorization bills were complicated by questions of shared oversight responsibilities.
In 1991, concerns arose that funding cuts for FY1992 intelligence programs might have been reallocated to other defense initiatives rather than used to reduce the budget deficit. Following the end of the Cold War, debates in Congress about the public disclosure of the intelligence budget resurfaced for the first time since 1975. During the consideration of the FY1992 intelligence authorization bill, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) proposed a bill (S. 1539) requiring the disclosure of three distinct versions of the total intelligence and related budget figures: the amount requested by the President, the amount authorized for appropriation by the conference committee, and the actual amount obligated by the executive branch. The SSCI excluded the published amount appropriated due to its doubt that such a figure could be accurately tallied by the time the report was issued.  The Senate Armed Services Committee, which received the bill through sequential referral, noted these requirements as significant departures from past practices of both Congress and the executive branch, with "profound implications for U.S. intelligence operations and policy formulation." The committee suggested postponing the effective date to FY1993 to allow for detailed consideration.  In contrast, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) version of the bill did not include any provisions regarding public disclosure of intelligence spending. The conference committee agreed with the objective of the Senate provisions but chose not to mandate their implementation by law. Instead, they expressed hope that "in 1993, [the] Committees will work with the President to make this information available to taxpayers who fund these activities in a manner that does not compromise U.S. national security." These provisions were included in Section 701 of the final legislation enacted as Public Law (P.L.).
Section 102-183 of the relevant legislation stated: It is the sense of Congress that, starting from 1993 and annually thereafter, the aggregate amount requested, authorized, and spent on intelligence and related activities should be disclosed publicly in an appropriate manner. The George H.W. Bush Administration's opposition may have significantly influenced the abandonment of mandatory disclosure requirements. President Bush, a former Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) who had previously argued against public disclosure in 1977, signed the final version with the statement: "Because secrecy is essential for the success of intelligence operations, the funding levels authorized by this Act are classified and should remain so." This was consistent with the Administration's stance, despite DCI nominee Robert Gates' confirmation hearing remarks in September 1991 suggesting, "From my perspective—though it ultimately rests with the President—I do not object to releasing the top-line number of the Intelligence Community budget. However, we need to consider other areas as well; this is a contentious issue."  In the following year, both intelligence committees concentrated on proposals for reorganizing the Intelligence Community and held extensive hearings on the question. The Senate version of the FY1993 intelligence authorization bill (S. 2991) incorporated the same "sense of Congress" provision that had appeared in the previous year's legislation. Although the House version (H.R. 5095) did not include a similar provision, the conference committee included the Senate amendment (as Section 303 in the final bill). There was no dissent among conferees who reiterated their hope that the intelligence committees would work with the President to make available the total funding for intelligence and related activities in 1993 without jeopardizing national security interests. On October 24, 1992, President Bush signed the legislation (P.L. 102-496) without comment.  With the Clinton Administration's inauguration in January 1993, some observers believed that this issue might be revisited with a different outcome.
Senator Howard Metzenbaum, a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), wrote to President Clinton on February 24, 1993, advocating for the public disclosure of the intelligence budget. Woolsey, the newly appointed Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), testified before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) on March 9, 1993, expressing concerns about disclosing the intelligence budget publicly: "There is no electronic or data fence around the United States or American citizens. Releasing this information and engaging in subsequent public debate would mean exposing it to people overseas whom we target with our intelligence assets."  Woolsey further explained his skepticism: "Disclosing a single number without context provides little meaningful information, necessitating public debate on reducing or increasing that figure. Such debates could inadvertently reveal sensitive details, making them potentially harmful."  President Clinton responded to Metzenbaum on March 27, requesting time to evaluate both the benefits and concerns associated with public disclosure. The House version of the FY1994 Intelligence Authorization bill (H.R. 2330) did not include any provisions for public disclosure. For the first time in three years, the Senate version (S. 1301) also omitted such provisions, according to Senator Arlen Specter, who noted that their absence was based on an expectation of a stronger resolution compelling disclosure.  On August 4, 1993, during debate on H.R. 2330 under an open rule, Representative Barney Frank proposed an amendment requiring the public disclosure of "the aggregate amounts requested and authorized for, and spent on, intelligence and intelligence-related activities" beginning in 1995. The amendment failed by a vote of 169-264. Many supporters of the Frank amendment also favored other budget-reducing measures, and observers anticipated that public disclosure could lead to increased calls for spending cuts from the public or Congress, depending on their perspective.
This view was not universally accepted. On October 18, 1993, Senator Daniel P. Moynihan introduced an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriation bill (H.R. 3116) requiring "a separate, unclassified statement of the aggregate amount of budget outlays for the prior fiscal year for national and tactical intelligence activities." The amendment included outlays for intelligence collection, analysis, production, dissemination, or support under the Department of Defense budget. Although Senator Moynihan, a critic of the Intelligence Community who had previously introduced legislation (S. 1682) to transfer CIA functions to the State Department, withdrew the amendment shortly after its introduction, it garnered support from Senator Daniel Inouye, then the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense.  Three weeks later, on November 10, 1993, Senator Metzenbaum proposed an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1994 Intelligence Authorization bill (S. 1301), which included similar "sense of Congress" language as in two previously enacted intelligence authorization bills. Although this provision had not been controversial in prior years, Republican incoming vice chairman Senator John Warner spoke out against it in 1993. After a lengthy debate, the Senate first voted 49-51 to not table the Metzenbaum amendment and then voted 52-48 to incorporate it into the bill with support from new SSCI Chairman Senator DeConcini.  The Committee of Conference on the two intelligence authorization bills met but did not include the provision for public disclosure of the intelligence budget in the final version. The conference report stated: "House conferees believed that, given the House vote [on the Frank amendment], they could not agree to include the Senate's 'sense of Congress' provisions and therefore voted to insist on their position." Consequently, the Fiscal Year 1994 Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L.) was enacted without this provision.
The members stated that while the details of intelligence spending should remain confidential, "the level of intelligence spending must be open to the public." They argued that "[t]he norms of our democratic system require that the public be informed." In a December 27, 1993 letter to Representative Glickman, the President opposed the proposal in 1993, believing it would outweigh any benefits. However, he directed Anthony Lake, National Security Adviser, along with the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and others, to reassess their stance in light of Glickman’s arguments and congressional consultations.  By January 1994, both the executive and legislative branches had committed to reviewing the issue of making intelligence spending levels public. Congressional hearings were scheduled for 1994, and an NSC-level review was initiated. At the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) hearings on February 22-23, 1994, DCI Woolsey reiterated his opposition to budgetary disclosure, citing the difficulty of conducting debates on intelligence programs in public and the risk that such transparency could inform adversaries about U.S. plans and operations.  The debate from 1994 to 1995 occurred amidst declining budgets and an evolving intelligence landscape, often described as a world with fewer clear threats but still filled with complex challenges. Despite these circumstances, on July 19, 1994, the House voted (in the Committee of the Whole) 194-221-24 to reject Representative Glickman's amendment to the intelligence authorization bill (H.R. 4299), which sought to amend the National Security Act of 1947 for annual reports on intelligence expenditures and requested amounts. The Senate version did not address this issue.  A similar situation arose in subsequent years, with the House again rejecting an amendment to make intelligence spending levels public, voting (in the Committee of the Whole) 154-271-9 against Representative Glickman's proposal on September 13, 1995.
In 1995, Representative Frank proposed disclosing aggregate amounts requested and authorized for intelligence and related activities, but the Senate bill did not include this provision. The Senate supported disclosure in 1996 by passing S. 1718 with a requirement that the President submit annual budget submissions including the previous year's appropriation and the next year’s request. However, on May 22, 1996, the House rejected Representative Conyers' amendment to H.R. 3259, which aimed for a separate unclassified statement of national and tactical intelligence funding. The Conference Committee followed the House's decision, omitting this provision.  In July 1997, Representatives Conyers proposed an amendment to H.R. 1775 requiring similar disclosure for fiscal year 1998, but it was rejected by a vote of 192-237 in the Committee of the Whole. The Senate also voted against a similar amendment on June 19, 1997, proposed by Senator Torricelli to require annual aggregate figures on intelligence funding.  Despite these votes, there remained interest and pressure for public disclosure of intelligence spending. The Aspin-Brown Commission, established under the FY1995 Intelligence Authorization Act (P.L. 103-359), recommended in 1996:...
At the start of each congressional budget cycle, the President or a designee must disclose the total amount of money appropriated for intelligence activities in the current fiscal year (including NFIP, JMIP, and TIARA) and the total amount requested for the next fiscal year. These disclosures can be included in the President's annual budget submission or sent separately as unclassified letters to the congressional intelligence committees. No further disclosures are authorized.  In response to the Commission's recommendations, on April 23, 1996, President Clinton allowed Congress to disclose the total appropriation for intelligence when the appropriations conference report was approved. However, this action was not implemented by the Legislative Branch.  In October 1997, DCI Tenet announced that President Clinton had authorized him to release the aggregate amount appropriated for intelligence and related activities for FY1997 ($26.6 billion). The decision was based on two key points: first, future disclosures of aggregate figures would only be considered after ensuring they do not harm national security by revealing trends over time; second, all subsidiary information about the intelligence budget would remain classified. The Administration intended to maintain this line at the top-level figure and avoid disclosing any more classified budget details.  The press release noted a previously filed lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act and stated that President Clinton had preferred joint action with Congress but was unable to act due to the current legal circumstances. In March 1998, Tenet announced that the aggregate amount for FY1998 was $26.7 billion, stating this release would not harm national security or intelligence operations.  This disclosure of the fiscal year 1998 figure marked the last such release.
Following litigants' attempts to compel the release of funds allocated for intelligence in addition to the publicly disclosed appropriation, Tenet refused to disclose the FY1999 appropriation amount. Some observers suggest that this reluctance may have stemmed from the inclusion of significant additional intelligence funds in the Supplemental Appropriation Act (P.L. 105-277), enacted on October 21, 1998. No such releases occurred subsequently.  The September 11, 2001 attacks had a profound impact on intelligence issues, shifting focus from reducing spending to understanding the lack of tactical warning that precipitated these events. Multiple investigations were initiated to assign responsibility and propose improvements in intelligence operations. Both the Executive Branch and Congress exhibited a clear inclination to significantly increase intelligence funding to support counterterrorism efforts.  While many recommendations for intelligence reorganization are beyond the scope of this report, some focused on acquisition and budgeting issues. Ultimately, the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was created, granting statutory authority to develop and determine the national intelligence budget, as well as ensuring its effective execution.  Additionally, the 9/11 Commission recommended that overall appropriations for national intelligence and its component agencies no longer be kept secret. This would contrast with the Clinton Administration's practice of disclosing total intelligence funding in FY1997 and FY1998. In response to these recommendations, Senate Bill S. 2845 proposed renaming the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) as the National Intelligence Program (NIP), requiring the President to disclose each fiscal year's requested NIP appropriation amount. Congress was also mandated to make public the authorized and appropriated amounts for the NIP.
The House bill addressing intelligence reorganization (H.R. 10) did not include a similar provision. An amendment seeking to remove this provision from the Senate bill was tabled on October 4, 2004, by a vote of 55 to 37. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458), enacted in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, did not incorporate the Senate’s provision for public disclosure of intelligence spending figures.  The issue resurfaced in 2006 when the Senate Intelligence Committee reported its version of the FY2007 authorization legislation (S. 3237). Section 107 of this bill mandated that the President disclose to the public the annual aggregate amount requested for the National Intelligence Program (NIP). Additionally, it required Congress to make public the authorized and appropriated amounts on an annual basis, which would likely include funds from supplemental appropriations bills. The legislation further mandated a study by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to assess the advisability of making such information public for each of the 16 elements of the Intelligence Community.  No similar provision was included in the House version of the FY2007 intelligence authorization bill (H.R. 5020). An identical provision was, however, included in the Senate's version of the FY2007 intelligence authorization bill (S. 372), which was reported in January 2007.  In considering this provision, Congress will likely weigh various factors. Some Members argue that not only constitutional provisions but also democratic principles have long required public identification of intelligence budgets. Even those who previously believed that Cold War conditions necessitated secrecy now contend that current enemies would no longer benefit from such information on overall levels of intelligence budgets. Opposing views exist, particularly in the House, which believe that declassifying the intelligence budget could inevitably compromise critical information on sources and methods.  Additional factors Members may consider include potential implications for national security and public trust.
Firstly, disclosing the National Intelligence Program (NIP) publicly might necessitate a separate intelligence appropriations bill, which could complicate trade-offs between intelligence and non-intelligence defense programs, potentially harming the overall intelligence effort. Secondly, actions in national intelligence efforts reflected in supplemental appropriations bills would need to be documented with more public justification than may be appropriate in certain circumstances. Additionally, revealing information on the NIP without detailing the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) could create a misleading impression of the intelligence budget's scope. Most observers contend that intelligence and intelligence-related activities are interdependent and should not be considered separately for accurate understanding of intelligence capabilities. This could impact stakeholders who seek to reduce overall intelligence spending as well as those arguing that current spending is inadequate relative to growing threats.  If intelligence-related activities were disclosed, similar to when the FY1997 and 1998 budget levels were made public by DCI Tenet, it would require recognizing the nuanced boundaries between these activities and other targeting and information-gathering efforts. There remains a risk of "budget games" where individual programs could be shifted to emphasize or de-emphasize intelligence spending.  Despite decades of debate, core issues surrounding public disclosure of the intelligence budget remain unresolved. Questions persist about whether constitutional requirements mandate such transparency and whether limited budgetary data can be shared without compromising classified programs or aiding adversaries. Beyond these concerns, there is a challenge in framing an informed public discourse on intelligence spending levels. How can one convey the complexity and diversity of U.S. intelligence efforts to the broader public?
The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted in early 1931 and, following amendments in the mid-1930s, it gradually became an integral component of federal contract practices. In the mid-1950s, the act gained more public visibility when the "prevailing wage principle" was incorporated into various federal statutes. For over four decades, and continuing into the 21st century, Davis-Bacon has consistently been a focal point of public policy discussions, influencing legislation, administrative rulemaking, and court litigation.  The 1931 Davis-Bacon Act requires that construction contracts entered by the federal government specify minimum wages for various classes of laborers. These wages are defined as those prevailing in the project's locality for similar crafts and skills on comparable work. In 1964, the concept of wages was expanded to include fringe benefits. The act has a coverage threshold of $2,000.  Beyond direct federal construction contracts, the Davis-Bacon "prevailing wage" principle is incorporated into more than 50 federal program statutes. It is also supported by the 1934 Copeland "anti-kickback" Act, which mandates weekly reporting of wages and confirms that all deductions have been proper. Additionally, federal overtime pay and health and safety standards statutes supplement it.  Furthermore, some states have enacted their own “little Davis-Bacon” acts to govern local construction projects.  The debate over the act's efficacy has remained largely unchanged throughout its history. Does it protect workers, stabilize the construction industry, or assist federal contractors? Or is it anti-competitive, hindering flexible workforce utilization? Has it been effectively administered, and can it be administered in a more equitable manner? Is there sufficient objective information to assess the statute and its impact fairly?  This report examines these policy issues that have defined the Davis-Bacon debate from its inception through the present day.
These key questions include wage rate determination procedures, reporting requirements under the Copeland Act, an appropriate threshold for triggering the statute, interagency relationships concerning Davis-Bacon enforcement and compliance activities, administrative or judicial appeal processes, the use of "helpers" and other low-skilled workers on covered projects, and the President's authority to suspend the statute along with the conditions surrounding such a suspension. The enduring debate over the fundamental premise of the act for 75 years may itself be part of the public policy discussion.  Historically, the act has garnered strong bipartisan support; however, since the mid-1950s, it has faced significant criticism. Federal agencies have publicly disagreed on the statute's usefulness and administration. The act has undergone judicial review and interpretation, with each new application subject to further examination.  Despite certain changes by the Department of Labor (DOL), the statute itself remains largely unchanged since 1935. Over the years, Congress has extended the act’s provisions to cover an increasingly broad range of federal and federally assisted construction projects. Such extensions have provided opportunities for renewed debates about the act's relevance and impact.  Critics argue that even if justified in 1931, the statute is now obsolete due to market changes and other federal labor standards laws, notably the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. They contend it is inflationary, increasing costs on public construction and potentially reducing job opportunities. Additionally, they assert it is anti-competitive, discriminatory against smaller firms, and administratively cumbersome.  Supporters maintain that Davis-Bacon remains as critical today as it was in the 1930s.
They argue that the Davis-Bacon Act prevents competition from "fly-by-night" firms that undercut local wages and working conditions, thereby unfairly competing with local contractors for federal work. This act is said to help stabilize the industry, benefiting both workers and employers. Additionally, by requiring firms to pay at least the locally prevailing wage, the act ensures higher-quality craftsmanship, as these firms are more likely to hire skilled workers. It may also reduce initial construction costs through greater efficiency and decrease the need for repairs or rehabilitation. The act discourages contractors from using low-skill, low-wage "helper" crews and promotes skill transfer through formal apprenticeship programs.  The literature on the Davis-Bacon Act is extensive and diverse, generally falling into three categories: public materials (such as legislative hearings and agency reports), journalistic pieces, and academic studies. Some of these academic works are commissioned by interest groups but can still be considered scholarly; others are independent academic efforts that sometimes blend scholarship with journalism.  Since the initial consideration of prevailing wage legislation at the federal level, numerous congressional hearings have reviewed the statute. However, many of these hearings focused broadly on policy concerns rather than specific economic impacts and their assessments.  As the Davis-Bacon debate has evolved, arguments have gone through several levels of affirmation and rebuttal, most of which are subject to further counterarguments. Despite significant gaps in our knowledge about the act, its administration, and impact, few studies—public or private—have escaped criticism due to flawed methodology or inadequate sample sizes.  Prevailing wage protection under public contracts originated at the state level and was later adopted by the federal government. Congressional interest in federal prevailing wage legislation predated both the "New Deal" and the 1929 economic collapse, emerging during a period of relative prosperity in the construction industry.
According to William Tracy of the Building Trades Department, AFL, the building industry was experiencing unprecedented prosperity, with wages, working hours, and conditions at their best in history. However, this period also witnessed turbulence and intense competition within the contracting community. During hearings before the House Committee on Labor in February 1927, Representative Robert L. Bacon (R-N.Y.) echoed Tracy's sentiments, noting that "wages are fair" in New York and there had been no significant disputes between employers and employees for some time. Bacon aimed to maintain this stability; he introduced legislation in 1927 requiring that locally prevailing wage standards be met for federal construction work.  However, issues arose with the construction of a federal hospital in Bacon's district. Local contractors submitted bids reflecting local standards, but the contract was awarded to an Alabama firm. Bacon reported that this company brought approximately one thousand non-union workers from Alabama into Long Island, New York; these workers were housed in poor conditions and paid low wages. In his view, government contracts should comply with existing local wage and labor standards.  Bacon's measure sought not to artificially inflate wages but to ensure the government respected local standards. The bill was not adopted. Similar legislation was introduced in 1928, garnering strong support from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). Commissioner of Labor Statistics Ethelbert Stewart noted that "the essence" of the proposal was whether the government would accept lower bids at the cost of breaking down labor standards and importing cheap labor across states. Both Secretary James J. Davis and Stewart fully supported the Bacon bill.
To date, hearings have predominantly supported the concept of prevailing wages, though not uniformly endorsing specific provisions in various proposals. Nevertheless, these efforts failed when Congress adjourned. In late 1930, after nearly a decade as Secretary of Labor (serving under Presidents Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover), James W. Davis transitioned to become a United States Senator. His first act was to introduce prevailing wage legislation, with Representative Bacon offering a concurrent bill.  The language in the Davis-Bacon proposals had been meticulously crafted by a committee representing all departments of the Hoover Administration, unanimously agreeing on its terms. William N. Doak, who succeeded Davis as Labor Secretary during the Hoover administration, testified in favor of the Davis-Bacon legislation, highlighting that current contracting practices were "disturbing both to labor and the business community."  Upon Senate consideration, Senator Robert LaFollette (Progressive Republican from Wisconsin), chairman of the Committee on Manufactures, urged rapid enactment. The report submitted by Senator Davis stated that the legislation did not establish new wage scales but merely granted the government the authority to require contractors to pay prevailing wages in project areas. This was deemed fair and just for employees, contractors, and the government alike.  A similar report was filed by Representative Richard J. Welch (R-Calif.) for the House Committee on Labor. Neither report recorded dissent; however, when the measure came before the House, reservations were expressed. Representative Thomas L. Blanton (D-Texas) criticized it as "the most ridiculous proposition I have ever seen brought before a legislative body," arguing that workers and contractors should be free to negotiate wages without government-imposed minimums.
The Texan observed that the bill proposed by representatives would strip American citizens, contractors, and laborers of their fundamental right to enter into binding agreements, thereby interfering with a sacred, inalienable right that has historically fostered initiative and independence among men. Representative Blanton appended to the Record a letter from Comptroller General J. R. McCarl, who raised concerns about determining prevailing wage rates after bids were submitted. McCarl argued that none of the parties involved could ascertain at the time of contracting what the prevailing rate would be, as it was to be determined post-submission. A. P. Greensfelder, President of the Associated General Contractors of America, agreed with McCarl’s assessment but acknowledged that contractors should still pay no less than the locally prevailing wage.  Additionally, Representative Anning Prall (D-N.Y.) argued that the enforcement provisions in the legislation were inadequate but still supported the bill. He stated that if unscrupulous contractors attempted to circumvent the law, it could be amended quickly to strengthen its enforcement mechanisms. The act was adopted without a roll call and signed into law by President Hoover on March 3, 1931.  Discontent with the act soon emerged among both laborers and contractors. Armand Thieblot, who has extensively written about the legislation, noted that it lacked effective policing or enforcement mechanisms and failed to inform workers of their newly granted protections. Trade unionists were particularly concerned that the $5,000 threshold for applicability could lead to contracts being fragmented to avoid the act's requirements, a matter especially pertinent to painting and decorating crafts.
The AFL's Executive Council recognized that the Davis-Bacon Act would prove beneficial, although they noted it was limited in scope. They proposed submitting future amendments to further benefit the building trades during subsequent sessions of Congress. One significant industry objection was that wage rates were determined after bids had been submitted, potentially forcing contractors to pay higher wages than those initially estimated. Thieblot, echoing Comptroller General McCarl's earlier concerns, explained that this post-determination of wages could force contractors to pay wages set by the Secretary of Labor, which might be higher than the rate used in their bid. This created a situation where contractors effectively bid without knowing the exact wage rates they would have to pay. Additionally, it was initially unclear what "prevailing" meant under the act, leading to potential ambiguity.  Efforts to address these issues were swift. In January 1932, the House Committee on Labor began oversight hearings. However, President Hoover responded by issuing Executive Order No. 5778 on January 19, 1932, which tightened the administration of the act. Behind-the-scenes negotiations for amending the act were intense, with organized labor initially advocating for a strengthened penalty structure in the statute. Representative William Connery (D-Mass.) recalled that representatives from the building trades, after meeting with Secretary Doak, struck a deal: if President Hoover issued an executive order on the Davis-Bacon bill, they would oppose any further legislative action by the Committee on Labor.  President Hoover's Executive Order mandated that all Davis-Bacon contracts include the stipulation that wages be paid in full not less than once a week, "in lawful money of the United States."
Representative Bacon stated that the Order "merely implements Congress's intentions from the law within the framework of government contracts." Secretary Doak noted that the act had "functioned far more successfully than many of us anticipated at the time of its passage," predicting it would "be particularly beneficial in maintaining stable wage rates and conditions for Federal building construction" and emphasizing there was "no need for additional legislation currently."  Industry, however, expressed dissatisfaction, arguing that wage rates should be disclosed prior to bidding. Senator Jesse Metcalf (R-R.I.) introduced a bill aimed at addressing industry's concerns by predetermining wage rates, allowing contract reopening during extended periods, adding an "anti-kickback" clause, and outlining enforcement procedures with penalties for violators. The Senate adopted the measure with minimal discussion and on a voice vote after hearings.  By June 1932, when the bill was brought to the House, opinions had solidified: labor opposed it, while industry supported its passage. The bill underwent significant modifications on the House floor, partly to appease labor concerns, but remained contentious.  During hearings and debates, various issues continued to spark controversy for the next six decades. For example: What defines a prevailing wage? How should a prevailing wage be determined and when? Should there be regional variations in standards? Are Davis-Bacon Act wages comparable between private and public construction? How should an appropriate locality be defined for wage determinations? How can issues of abuse under the act, such as kickbacks, be addressed effectively? Should the act's protections extend to production of prefabricated materials used in construction? Is the act only beneficial to employed construction workers, potentially unnecessary protection for this class? Does the act limit employment opportunities in the construction industry?  These questions remained unresolved in the short term. The amended bill passed the House and was subsequently approved by the Senate after conference.
On June 13, 1934, President Roosevelt signed the Copeland Act, an amendment that supplements the Davis-Bacon Act. This measure stipulates fines of up to $5,000 and imprisonment for up to five years, or both, for anyone who coerces a construction worker into giving up part of their compensation through force, intimidation, threats, or other means. The Copeland Act also authorized administrative agencies to create reasonable enforcement regulations, mandating that contractors and subcontractors provide weekly sworn affidavits detailing wages paid to employees.  In a broader examination of federal contracting policies, Senator David Walsh (D-Mass.) oversaw the Davis-Bacon Act's effectiveness. He concluded that the statute was insufficient in addressing many contractor practices, a view supported by other relevant departments. By spring 1935, Senator Walsh proposed significant amendments, including reducing the coverage threshold from $5,000 to $2,000; extending coverage to all federal contract construction, regardless of nature; authorizing withholding of funds by contracting agencies to ensure proper wages for workers; directing the Comptroller General to compile a list of contractors who have violated their obligations and banning those listed for three years from future contracts.
Laborers would be granted a "right of action or intervention" in court against contractors, ensuring they could pursue legal recourse regardless of their agreement to accept wages lower than the required rate or any subsequent voluntary refunds. According to the Davis-Bacon Act, contracts had to specify the minimum wages for various classes of laborers and mechanics, establishing these rates before bids were submitted by contractors. Although some provisions might have been contentious, the Walsh amendments were passed in both the Senate and House without debate. The Committee on Labor noted that the bill was a logical extension of Congress’s ongoing policy regarding minimum wages on public construction projects. In the House, the bill was swiftly adopted without discussion. It was signed into law by the President a week later.  For two decades following 1935, the Davis-Bacon Act became an integral part of federal contract policy, though its history during this period remains largely unexplored. The act was grounded in the principle that as a consumer, the United States has the right to enforce certain standards through contracts. Contractors undertaking federal construction work had to adhere to stated specifications, including labor standards.  In 1936, this principle was extended to contract purchases of goods with the passage of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. The final piece of legislation in this series, the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act, which came into effect in 1965, further expanded these labor standards.  In 1938, Congress introduced broader minimum wage and overtime provisions for the private sector through the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This wide-ranging wage/hour legislation may have diminished some interest in the Davis-Bacon and Walsh-Healey Acts.
Indeed, some have argued that the Davis-Bacon Act was no longer necessary following the implementation of broader labor protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In 1940, the act's protections were extended to Hawaii and Alaska. By 1941, its provisions were applied to construction contracts on a cost-plus/negotiated basis. During World War II, federal contracting evolved, and government procurement agencies alongside international unions entered into agreements that stabilized wages and conditions, crucial for the war effort. President Harry Truman later recalled that these agreements "served us well during the war," noting with pride the "splendid record of cooperation with the Davis-Bacon Division." However, by 1947, most wartime controls had been lifted. Throughout the evolution of the Davis-Bacon Act, a persistent issue arose regarding its administration: whether it rested with the Department of Labor (DOL), contracting agencies, or perhaps the General Accounting Office (GAO). In an effort to enhance order, cooperation, and efficiency post-New Deal and World War II, President Truman proposed Reorganization Plan No. 2 in 1947. This plan consolidated certain labor standards activities under the Secretary of Labor. The plan authorized the Secretary "to coordinate the administration of the acts for regulating wages and hours on Federal public works by establishing such standards, regulations, and procedures" to ensure more effective enforcement. In March 1950, Truman issued Reorganization Plan No.
In his 14th point, Mr. Truman highlighted the confusion caused by interagency involvement in enforcing various laws regulating wages and hours for workers on Federal contracts for public works or construction. Specifically, he referenced the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts, along with certain federal overtime pay laws, as well as labor standards provisions added to construction program statutes involving projects "financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from the Federal Government or by mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Government." Truman noted that "[t]he methods adopted by various agencies for enforcing labor standards vary widely in character and effectiveness," leading to a lack of uniformity and differing levels of worker protection. To address this, President Truman authorized the Secretary of Labor "to coordinate the administration of legislation relating to wages and hours on Federally financed or assisted projects."   In presenting the plan to Congress, Mr. Truman acknowledged that "[s]ince the primary objective of the plan is more effective enforcement of labor standards, it is unlikely to result in savings. However," he added, "it will provide more uniform and adequate protection for workers through the necessary enforcement expenditures."  Coverage issues during the Truman Era—such as direct federal construction versus projects financed through grants and loans—continued to be contentious into the 21st century. Similarly, legislative proposals have continued to debate the Secretary of Labor’s role in administering the Davis-Bacon Act. These issues remain unresolved.  By the end of the Truman Era, prevailing wage requirements (the Davis-Bacon principle) had been expanded from direct federal construction to projects funded entirely or partially by federal funds.
During the Eisenhower Administration, extensions of prevailing wage coverage became increasingly common. The 1950s debates over the Davis-Bacon Act revisited many earlier arguments for and against the legislation, introducing a few new concerns as well. However, these discussions failed to resolve much. In 1955, several Senators, dissenting from prevailing congressional policy, argued that adding a Davis-Bacon provision to program legislation would expand federal bureaucracy, generate paperwork and litigation, increase agency control, and pose definitional issues regarding classification, locality, and prevailing rates—issues that would resurface during the Reagan/Bush Era. Similarly, in 1958, Senator Strom Thurmond (D-S.C.) contended that the Department of Labor had mismanaged the act, suggested that Davis-Bacon wage standards were being improperly applied to rural areas, thereby raising rural wages, and criticized federal overreach into state rights. These arguments, largely those of the South Carolinian, would become recurring themes in debates and litigation for decades.  From a different philosophical perspective, Senator Clifford Case (R-N.J.) maintained that the Davis-Bacon Act protects "fairminded and responsible contractors against unfair competition from contractors who base their bids on wage levels lower than those actually prevailing in the area." He also noted the act's benefits to workers. Senator Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.), echoing concerns voiced in the 1930s, warned that "we must guard against ... the breaking down of the wage pattern in a particular area."  Despite differing opinions on the prevailing wage statute during the 1950s and opposition to it, Congress continued to uphold and extend Davis-Bacon coverage through various federal program statutes. A quick review of legislative activity from the Eisenhower Era suggests that attaching Davis-Bacon provisions to program statutes was more controversial and sparked more heated debate than the initial passage of the act itself.
By the mid-1950s, many Republicans in Congress still claimed credit for the Davis-Bacon Act. For instance, Representative Russell Mack (R-Wash.) stated that Senator James Davis of Pennsylvania and Representative John Bacon of New York were the two authors of this law. The Republican House and Senate passed it, and President Herbert Hoover, a Republican, signed it into law. Thus, the Davis-Bacon provision we discuss today is a 25-year-old piece of Republican legislation.  However, despite Representative Mack's assertions, the Davis-Bacon Act was not seen as a partisan creation. Debates both in committee and on the floor involved lawmakers from both parties. At least some Republicans supported it for its benefits to contractors. As Representative Thor Tollefson (R-Wash.) recalled, "The Davis-Bacon Act has been valuable as a remedial measure to protect contractors and craftsmen from unfair contract bids." He also noted that a provision was necessary to eliminate the bidding advantages of contractors who paid low wages in union-dominated areas.  Furthermore, concerns about the cost impact of the Davis-Bacon Act divided opinions. In a 1956 report on highway legislation, five members dissented, citing economic reasons for opposing it. They argued that including the Davis-Bacon provision would increase highway costs by $2 to $4 billion, resulting in less highway infrastructure for the money spent. They noted that the administrative and bureaucratic processes required for wage fixing could lead to wasteful expenditure without any benefit.  Conversely, Representative Mack (R-Wash.) defended the act, stating it merely "kept wages at the prevailing rate." He argued that while the law did not raise wages, it prevented wage cuts and labor standards from being lowered.
Mack stated that the Washington State Highway Commission had supported the Davis-Bacon provision. Gardner Withrow (R-Wis.) promptly agreed with Mack, asserting that "the cost of highway construction would not be any greater than it currently is." Withrow further affirmed that "responsible road officials in Wisconsin declare that the current costs under the Davis-Bacon Act would remain unchanged," concluding that "the argument that it would significantly increase the cost of building roads is entirely unfounded."  There was also a division in the Senate regarding Davis-Bacon coverage. The initial 1955 highway legislation did not address this issue, but organized labor had advocated for specific prevailing wage provisions during hearings. When the legislation was reported, a Davis-Bacon provision was added. However, Senators Edward Martin (R-Pa.), Prescott Bush (R-Conn.), and Norris Cotton (R-N.H.) opposed this addition, arguing that it would expand federal bureaucracy, create paperwork and litigation, increase federal agency control, and pose definitional problems related to classification, locality, and prevailing rates.  On the Senate floor, extensive debate ensued. Senator Dennis Chavez (D-N.M.) proposed removing the prevailing wage language, which was subsequently restored by the House. The provision was retained in conference and became law in 1956.  During the Eisenhower era, some members expressed confusion over why the Davis-Bacon act remained controversial. Representative Katharine St. George (R-N.Y.) questioned "whether it is not a fact that the Davis-Bacon provision has been part of the law for many years without any objections until now." Similarly, Representative Frank Smith (D-Miss.) noted that "all of our committee has voted many times for bills which include Davis-Bacon."  Early in the 1960s, major federal construction programs began in defense and space, highlighting the increasing importance of federal contract labor standards.
There was a perception, whether justified or not, that the federal construction program faced significant labor-management challenges. Some argued that critical projects were being delayed due to conflicts between rival unions with jurisdictional disputes leading to strikes or walkouts. It was also claimed that such labor issues were unnecessarily increasing the cost of public construction.  Disputes over turf involving both workers and contracting or supply firms affected the application of federal contract labor standards laws. Since the wage requirements under Davis-Bacon were generally higher than those under Walsh-Healey, employers might have preferred to classify as much work as possible as "manufacturing" rather than "construction," thereby reducing labor costs.  In defense and aerospace construction, the work extended beyond mere bricklaying and mortar setting. For instance, if a worker installed technical electronic equipment, was this part of the "manufacturing" process covered by the Walsh-Healey Act, or did it fall under "construction" subject to the Davis-Bacon Act's higher wage requirements? Prefabrication of components for general construction further complicated matters; for example, was a batch plant some distance from the site still considered within the scope of Davis-Bacon regulations?  Congress addressed these issues by passing the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act in 1965, which mandated labor standards for service workers but with different requirements than those under Davis-Bacon or Walsh-Healey. This created uncertainty as to whether technical installations could be classified as construction, manufacturing, or a service operation.  Collective bargaining agreements also played a role; how work was defined (by craft or skill) might determine jurisdictional disputes between unions. In 1962, a Special Subcommittee on Labor, chaired by Representative James Roosevelt (D-Calif.), was established to provide the first full-scale hearing on these issues in nearly three decades.
Roosevelt promptly dispatched the Subcommittee to inspect defense and space installations firsthand to "gain direct knowledge of the administration of the Davis-Bacon Act." Formal hearings followed, focusing on three key areas: (1) how the Secretary of Labor determines prevailing wages and the criteria used; (2) whether a review process should be established for these determinations; and (3) any constructive suggestions to improve or clarify the act. Despite Roosevelt's efforts to keep the agenda narrow, over the course of three years, a wide array of complaints and proposals emerged, setting the stage for subsequent Davis-Bacon hearings and establishing a 30-year agenda.  When an interested party was dissatisfied with a Department of Labor (DOL) decision related to the Davis-Bacon Act, their options were limited to requesting reconsideration from DOL. The need for a formal review procedure had been discussed since at least the mid-1950s but remained unimplemented. In 1962, Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg appeared before the Roosevelt Subcommittee and highlighted an "important innovation" under consideration—internal review machinery within DOL—to address challenged determinations.  It soon became clear that establishing a review mechanism would be contentious. Various proposals were presented, each supported by different groups. Some advocated for internal review panels, while others argued such systems could never fully eliminate bias from the Secretary’s staff.
The need for judicial review was proposed but deemed impractical due to its complexity, cost, and potential delays affecting federal projects. An alternative, review by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), was also considered but led to controversy given the frequent disagreements between the Comptroller General and the Department of Labor (DOL) over Davis-Bacon administration.  If an in-house board were established, numerous administrative questions would arise, such as who would appoint its members, where it should be housed, and how it would interact with the Secretary and the Wage and Hour Division's Administrator within DOL. Further considerations included whether internal administrative appeals would suffice or if additional options would be necessary.  Through 1962 and 1963, no legislative review procedure was finalized until January 3, 1964, when Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz administratively created the Wage Appeals Board (WAB). The board consisted of three members appointed by Wirtz, with one designated as chairman. According to Wirtz’s order, the WAB would act as his authorized representative in deciding appeals related to Davis-Bacon Act wage determinations and their associated minimum wage statutes.  For legal questions, the Solicitor at DOL would advise and represent the Department during proceedings. Six months later, on June 23, 1964, Labor Solicitor Charles Donahue testified before the Subcommittee, assuring them that the review process was operational. Some interpreted Wirtz’s action as a preemptive measure against pending legislative proposals for a formal review procedure.
Representative Roman Pucinski (D-Ill.) observed: "The Department's actions reflect an inevitable shift in policy." Initially, when the 1964 Davis-Bacon amendments were introduced, Congress did not incorporate a review procedure; hence, the arrangement established by the Secretary remained unchanged. The primary considerations of the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act were stability and fairness within the construction market. At that time, it was assumed that without a prevailing wage requirement, contractors might underbid on public works based on low wages and poor working conditions inconsistent with local norms. In 1964, following this assumption, Congress expanded the definition of "prevailing wage" to include fringe benefits.  Supporters argued that contractors bound by collective bargaining agreements typically provide their workers with various fringe benefits such as health insurance and paid vacation time. Non-union firms might offer similar benefits voluntarily but are not legally obligated to do so. Therefore, it was reasoned that non-union contractors who offer fewer or no fringe benefits could unfairly underbid union or other non-union employers who integrate these benefits into their total compensation packages.  Critics contended that adding a fringe benefit component would increase the cost of public construction. They argued that calculating the value of varying fringe benefit packages would be challenging due to significant differences between firms and employment situations. Some maintained that, even if justified, this issue should not be considered in isolation but as part of broader Davis-Bacon reform.  When the Roosevelt Subcommittee proposed legislation incorporating a fringe benefit component into Davis-Bacon wage calculations, it faced little controversy. The provision was supported by the Johnson Administration. Passed in the House on January 28, 1964, with a vote of 357 to 50, and unanimously approved in the Senate on June 23, 1964, this legislation marked an important expansion of the Act.  The original 1931 Davis-Bacon Act included a provision authorizing the President to suspend the statute "in the event of a national emergency."
The authors of the Davis-Bacon Act established broad terms for legislation without defining "national emergency" or specifying the duration of any suspension. Before examining President Nixon's 1971 suspension of the act, it is useful to briefly review Franklin Roosevelt’s 1934 suspension.  On June 5, 1934, President Roosevelt, advised by the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of Public Works, suspended Davis-Bacon for administrative convenience. This was to avoid the "administrative confusion and delay" caused by the concurrent operation of the Davis-Bacon Act and the National Industrial Recovery Act. No specific definition of "national emergency" was provided; instead, Roosevelt noted that these statutes were creating operational difficulties.  Subsequently, just three weeks later, on June 30, 1934, President Roosevelt issued another proclamation, stating that a revocation of the earlier proclamation would be in the public interest and reinstating Davis-Bacon. He did not provide further public explanation for his actions.  From 1970 to 1971, President Richard Nixon expressed significant concern over inflation, particularly regarding wage-price structures in the construction industry. On January 18, 1971, he met with the Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Commission, chaired by labor economist John Dunlop, and urged them to address the "wage-price spiral" in construction. Discussions included suspending Davis-Bacon as an option.  Nixon seemed inclined towards a private sector solution and set a 30-day period for negotiations. Despite meetings between key figures including AFL-CIO President George Meany, OMB Director George Shultz, Secretary James Hodgson, Dunlop, and others, no concrete agreement was reached. On February 23, 1971, Nixon suspended Davis-Bacon.
He observed that the nation faces a critical situation arising from conditions in the construction industry. These include excessive collective bargaining settlements and increasing work stoppages, leading to a wage/price spiral that impacts the broader economy. Consequently, he suspended the Act, along with any executive orders or rules related to wage payments dependent on determinations by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act. President Nixon acknowledged that his action targeted organized labor but also noted that federal project wages had been artificially set due to this law rather than market forces. He believed such preferential arrangements were detrimental during a period of rising wage pressures.  Furthermore, he removed the Davis-Bacon provisions from over 50 program statutes and called on state and other governmental bodies with similar laws to take comparable actions. The suspension seemed more aimed at encouraging labor and management—primarily labor—to adopt what Nixon deemed a more responsible wage/price policy.  President Nixon highlighted that decisive government action was needed to protect public interests while allowing continued efforts to address the underlying issues. Many questions emerged regarding whether inflationary construction industry wages, including federal ones, were intended by Congress when drafting the "national emergency" provision of the act. There were also doubts about whether the President had authority under this provision to eliminate not just Davis-Bacon but also prevailing wage provisions in decades-old federal statutes.
Could the President preempt state "little Davis-Bacon Acts"? According to Hodgson, suspending these laws would help produce more reasonable settlements across the industry and restore balance in the bargaining process. Although he did not define "reasonable" or a better balance, his intent was clear: if unions moderated their demands for less costly wage agreements, balance could be restored, potentially reviving Davis-Bacon provisions.  The AFL-CIO's Meany viewed the suspension as punitive against workers and an invitation to employers to exploit them. Labor analyst John Herling noted that the suspension pleased the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which had long sought to remove Davis-Bacon from federal law. Some state prevailing wage laws predated the federal statute, raising questions about their interaction with the suspension.  U.S. Solicitor of Labor Peter G. Nash stated that under "negative" preemption, states were barred from applying their own prevailing wage standards to federally assisted construction work subject to DBRA protections before February 23, 1971. However, this view was not universally accepted; New York's Commissioner of Labor Louis Levine maintained that state prevailing wage rates would continue for public construction projects.  Following the President’s urging and under Dunlop's guidance, representatives from labor and management continued to meet. On March 29, 1971, Nixon declared in Executive Order 11588 that the suspension was no longer needed due to an established stabilization plan. With the creation of the Construction Industry Stabilization Committee—a tripartite body directed by John Dunlop—Nixon restored Davis-Bacon and its related regulations.  Davis-Bacon had been a central issue for policymakers since the mid-1950s.
During and shortly after the Carter Administration, the Davis-Bacon Act experienced a heightened level of visibility, with vigorous pro-and-con arguments being voiced. This period of tension can be traced back to debates surrounding the original prevailing wage legislation. The bills that eventually became the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 were partly crafted in response to rulings from then Comptroller General J. R. McCarl of the General Accounting Office (GAO), who stated that the federal government, when contracting for construction work, was obligated to accept the lowest responsible bid. The term "responsibility" during this period generally referred to fiduciary matters and the bidder's ability to complete the contracted work; wages and working conditions were not considered factors. Due to this interpretation, Labor Secretary Doak explained that legislation was necessary.  Comptroller General McCarl had reviewed early versions of the Davis-Bacon legislation, offering suggestions for improvement but his advice was not immediately acted upon. However, the issues he raised continued to be relevant and provided a basis for ongoing GAO interest in the statute. According to the Davis-Bacon Act, the GAO has responsibilities regarding the debarment of contractors found in violation of the statute and plays a role in managing certain aspects of federal expenditures. Additionally, it oversees broader federal spending.  On June 12, 1962, J. E. Welch, Deputy General Counsel at the GAO, appeared before the Roosevelt Subcommittee to discuss oversight hearings on the Davis-Bacon Act. Welch noted that since 1935, the GAO had examined nearly every reported case involving irregularities under the act. He stated that their experience indicated that the methods and procedures used by the Department of Labor (DOL) for administering the act had not kept up with the evolving requirements of the period.
He assured the panel that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was neutral on whether the Davis-Bacon Act should be continued or repealed. A lengthy discussion aimed to clarify GAO's relationship with the Department of Labor (DOL) concerning the Davis-Bacon Act, but no precise conclusion was reached. It became evident that GAO and DOL were not operating in harmony. Welch noted an ongoing series of negotiations between the Comptroller, the Solicitor at DOL, and their aides, which seemed to define areas of disagreement rather than resolve conflicts. He concluded that for DOL to have final responsibility over the Davis-Bacon Act, "it should be accomplished by appropriate amendment to the act."  Both GAO and the Subcommittee set the issue aside temporarily but added a supplement to its oral testimony with extended documentation questioning DOL's administration of the act. Since the early 1960s, GAO had issued several reports critical of DOL’s management of the Federal prevailing wage law. Each report expressed growing dissatisfaction with the act's implementation. In April 27, 1979, GAO released a comprehensive review titled bluntly, "The Davis-Bacon Act Should Be Repealed." The report was immediately controversial; some questioned its scholarship and wondered if it was appropriate for GAO to directly challenge a policy Congress had supported for nearly half a century. Nonetheless, this study and previous reports provided critics with valuable resources. In urging Congress to repeal the act, GAO outlined several arguments: first, "significant changes in economic conditions and the economic character of the construction industry since 1931, plus the passage of other wage laws, make the act unnecessary." Second,
After nearly five decades, the Department of Labor (DOL) has failed to establish an effective program for issuing and maintaining current and accurate wage determinations; it may be impractical to ever achieve such a system. Furthermore, the Davis-Bacon Act results in unnecessary construction and administrative costs estimated at several hundred million dollars annually, based on GAO reviews, and has an inflationary impact on areas covered by inaccurate wage rates and the economy as a whole.  Although the 1979 GAO report was influential, it did not garner universal approval, as evidenced by its frequent citations. During June 1979 hearings, several Members of Congress questioned the GAO's proactive stance. Representative Frank Thompson (D-N.J.) inquired about how much of the GAO’s work was initiated independently, to which Comptroller General Elmer Staats responded that he believed all Davis-Bacon studies were self-initiated.  Ray Marshall, an economist at the University of Texas and Secretary of Labor when the GAO report was released, criticized it as "very sloppy" economic analysis with little credibility. Despite defending its findings, the GAO noted that DOL largely disagreed with the report's contentions. In three congressional committee hearings on Davis-Bacon, representatives from both DOL and GAO voiced areas of disagreement regarding the report and the act. While these hearings did not resolve the methodological and interpretative conflicts surrounding the act, they increased its visibility.  Coverage disputes in the early 1960s over whether to apply Davis-Bacon or Walsh-Healey labor standards protections were never fully resolved. As previously noted, Congress passed the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA) in 1965, extending labor standards requirements to federal service contracts. In 1972 and 1976, amendments to the SCA were adopted over contractor objections. This resulted in a jurisdictional issue that became a three-way contest involving Davis-Bacon, Walsh-Healey, and the SCA.  These statutes, while similar and complementary, have distinct regulatory and economic impacts.
The application of specific statutes to construction projects was a matter of significant interest for employers, workers, federal agencies as consumers of goods and services, and taxpayers. In 1974, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established an inter-agency task force to review the implementation of McNamara-O'Hara; however, after completing the review, the Department of Labor (DOL) declined to concur in the findings, resulting in a stalemate. In January 1977, during the transition from the Ford to Carter Administrations, OMB issued a unilateral directive mandating administrative changes, which was later reversed when OFPP withdrew the directive due to the need for the new Administration to consider the issues.  In the summer of 1978, disagreements emerged between OFPP and DOL. The OFPP Administrator informed the Department of Defense (DOD) that contracts for aircraft engine overhaul would be governed by Walsh-Healey (the federal minimum wage) instead of the locally prevailing rate under McNamara-O'Hara. In response, the House Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations held hearings in August 1978. At the request of several key Congress members, OFPP stepped back and referred the matter to Attorney General Griffin Bell for a legal decision regarding OFPP's authority.  In March 1979, Bell ruled in favor of DOL, affirming that whether a particular class of contracts falls under Walsh-Healey or the Service Contract Act (SCA) is determined by the Secretary of Labor. However, he noted that the Secretary was subject to the President's supervision and direction as Chief Executive.  Another interagency dispute arose in June 1979 when DOL notified the General Services Administration (GSA) that contracts for automatic data processing services would be covered by SCA. The Department of Defense opposed this, arguing that meeting SCA prevailing wage standards could raise wages and disrupt industry salary structures. Industry representatives agreed with DOD's stance, leading to conflicts between contractors and the contracting agency.  At this point, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report suggesting that McNamara-O'Hara should not apply to service employees of data processing and high-technology firms.
The industry took a firm stance, threatening to forego federal automatic data processing contracts if the Department of Labor (DOL) insisted that the Service Contract Act (SCA) applied to workers in that field. Although an outright conflict was avoided temporarily, such policy disputes were ultimately left to President Carter's discretion following the Bell decision. In August 1978, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) convened an Inter-Agency Task Force to review the operation of Davis-Bacon and SCA. However, this task force seemed overtaken by concurrent events: independent oversight by the House Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations in summer 1978, and a determination rendered by Attorney General Bell in spring 1979, both discussed previously. Additionally, staff changes within several agencies contributed to shifts in focus and priorities.  The only outcome from the Inter-Agency Task Force's work was a listing of policy options, which appeared to be "essentially shelved" for two years. In summer 1979, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) requested copies of all Task Force recommendations and any rejected policy options from Labor Secretary Ray Marshall. DOL agreed to provide what could be made available to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.  While it seems that the Task Force report was not publicly available when it was released early in 1980, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for these materials. When this failed, the Chamber sued in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia in June 1980, seeking an order for their release. Legal action continued until 1981; however, with the 1980 elections and the advent of the Reagan Administration, the issue may have become moot. On March 18, 1981, Senator Hatch released a document titled "Options Paper: Inter-Agency Review of Contract Wage Laws."
The Options Paper provided little new insight or documentation and offered minimal information on the work of the task force. Amid increasing pressure to reform the Davis-Bacon Act, the Carter Administration published proposed regulations in December 1979. Over many months, the Department of Labor reviewed public comments and finalized the regulations on January 16, 1981, which took effect on February 14, 1981. President Reagan, upon taking office, decided to review all pending regulations instead of allowing them to proceed as they were. Consequently, the Carter-era regulations were withdrawn for further examination.  In August 1981, the Reagan Administration proposed new Davis-Bacon regulations and solicited public comment. On May 28, 1982, final regulations were published to go into effect on July 27, 1982. In a memorandum to Vice President George Bush and members of the President’s Task Force on Regulatory Relief, Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan stated that "the final rule should be very well received by contractor groups," while acknowledging potential adverse reactions from labor. Indeed, organized labor criticized the new regulations as a "back door attempt to nullify the law." The AFL-CIO's Executive Council noted that these regulations were “a laundry list of virtually every proposal offered over the years” by contractor associations. In contrast, the Chamber of Commerce’s Washington Report deemed the regulations a "major improvement," stating that they would be beneficial for construction trade associations and the business community as a whole.  The regulations issued on May 28, 1982, can be seen as a summary of unresolved policy questions from the initial discussions of the act in the 1920s and 1930s, as well as issues reviewed since then. They primarily addressed five key areas:
Under the pre-Reagan system, if a wage rate paid to 30% of workers in a craft within a locality was not otherwise covered by a broader-based rate, it could be deemed "prevailing" for Davis-Bacon purposes. The new regulations replaced this with a "50 percent" rule.  Secondly, it had been alleged that the Department of Labor (DOL) was setting locally prevailing wage rates by importing urban standards into rural areas. The revised regulations imposed stringent limitations on such practices.  Thirdly, it was claimed that DOL included wages from other federal (Davis-Bacon-covered) projects in its data base when determining Davis-Bacon wage rates, which some argued could lead to an upward adjustment of the base rate.   Fourthly, the new regulations broadened the use of "helpers" on federal construction projects—unskilled and general utility workers. Industry contended that this would reduce costs, open opportunities for unskilled labor, and increase employer flexibility. However, labor argued it could result in craft fragmentation, decrease employment of skilled workers, and lower wages for those working on federal contracts.  Fifthly, under the Copeland "anti-kickback" Act of 1934, contractors must file weekly payroll reports and affirm compliance with Davis-Bacon pay requirements. The new regulations retained the affirmation requirement but mandated submission of payroll records only during enforcement or compliance actions.  All these changes were opposed by organized labor, particularly those concerning the use of "helpers" and the reporting requirements under Copeland. On June 11, 1982, the Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL-CIO, along with others, filed a lawsuit to prevent implementation of the new regulations. Just as these changes were set to take effect on July 22, 1982, Judge Harold Greene of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a preliminary injunction. On December 23, 1982, Judge Greene ruled in favor of the union position, with one key exception: he upheld Secretary Donovan's substitution of the "50 percent" rule for the previous "30 percent" rule.
With that single exception, he declared the regulations invalid and "permanently enjoined [the Secretary and his agents] from enforcing or giving any effect to" the new rules. Fifteen Secretaries of Labor serving eight Presidents had never altered the regulatory scheme, Judge Greene affirmed, and the present Secretary's claim to have discovered a different congressional intent was deemed hollow by historical evidence. Both parties appealed; in January 1983, the Department of Justice challenged Judge Greene’s decision on behalf of the DOL, while the Building and Construction Trades Department announced it would appeal the favorable portion of the decision, specifically addressing the "30 percent" rule.  On July 5, 1983, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a split decision. It noted that the legislative history of the act, while “not crystal clear,” suggested Congress intended to allow the Secretary to determine prevailing wages in the best way possible. In general, the Court deferred to the Secretary’s authority: first, it permitted implementation of the "50 percent" rule and/or an averaging procedure; second, it upheld the right to exclude distant urban data from rural wage rate calculations; third, it allowed exclusion of wage data from federal projects unless no suitable alternative was available; fourth, the Court partially approved and partially denied the new rules on the use of “helpers,” directing DOL to amend the proposed regulation. On January 24, 1989, DOL promulgated a revised final rule dealing with "helpers," which received court approval. However, Congress refused to fund implementation of this rule, leaving it unresolved.  Lastly, the Appeals Court concurred with the District Court that changes in the Copeland Act's reporting requirements would weaken Davis-Bacon enforcement and conflict with statutory intent, thus exceeding the Secretary’s authority. The Department continued to experiment with language altering these requirements, and the issue became a subject of various legislative proposals, none of which were enacted.
Gradually, the Copeland reporting issue seemed to fade from the policy agenda, with previous requirements remaining intact. In January 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a further appeal by the Building Trades. After five years of active consideration, DOL's "reform" efforts had been sustained in three out of five areas but denied in two: the "helper" issue and the Copeland reporting requirements.  As discussed earlier, two suspensions occurred during the first 60 years of the act’s history. In 1934, President Roosevelt suspended the act briefly for administrative convenience. In 1971, President Nixon similarly suspended it briefly to apply economic pressure on construction contractors and building trades unions as part of his wage/price control strategy.  In early 1992, reports emerged that a third suspension might be under consideration, this time by President George Bush, using the act's authority. Such considerations began during the first months of the year, with predictions in June suggesting a nationwide suspension was "more likely than not." However, the issue soon faded from public view.  On October 14, 1992, President Bush ordered the Davis-Bacon Act suspended for certain jurisdictions in Florida, Louisiana, and Hawaii through Proclamation 6491. Citing recent hurricanes that had struck these states as a "national emergency," he declared: "... I find the conditions caused by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki to constitute a 'national emergency' within the meaning of Section 6 of the Davis-Bacon Act." The suspension was to continue "until otherwise provided."  In suspending the act, President Bush introduced several new elements to the concept of "national emergency," which had previously served as a basis for presidential action. First, he argued that suspension could enhance employment opportunities by creating up to five to eleven thousand new jobs in these states' construction industries, according to an unexplained DOL estimate. Second, he viewed it as an economy measure.
The suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act would likely increase costs for rebuilding facilities in several regions due to locally prevailing wage rates set by the Secretary of Labor. Additionally, if the act were suspended, more construction companies would be eligible to bid on federal contracts. The Administration argues that, since its inception over half a century ago, the Davis-Bacon Act has imposed non-market wage rates, historically excluding semi-skilled workers—many of whom are African-American, Hispanic, or new immigrants—from federal contracting projects.  Furthermore, the suspension order and accompanying documents also cite financial concerns, specifically the addition of billions to the federal deficit due to costly local wage settlements in the construction industry. While these assumptions were subject to debate, some suggested that Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki served more as a justification for an action already under consideration rather than the primary reason for the suspension.  The opinion on this matter was divided. Proponents within the construction industry, especially those aligned with non-union or anti-union policies, praised the suspension, arguing it could potentially strengthen the economy if applied broadly. Conversely, organized labor expressed dismay at the President's action, perceiving it as a "desperate attempt" to secure support in electoral battleground states like Florida and Louisiana.  Representative William Ford (D-Mich.), Chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, criticized the Bush proclamation, alleging that the President was using the "desperation" of affected residents as an opportunity to cut wages and appease U.S. Chamber of Commerce contributors.
Ford committed to "examine the President's actions when the new 103rd Congress convenes." Early in the 103rd Congress, Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) introduced legislation urging the President to amend the suspension proclamation by removing all references to the State of Hawaii and Hurricane Iniki. Over the years, numerous Members of Congress criticized the foundational premise of the Davis-Bacon Act. Some argued that if a suspension was beneficial, full repeal might be even more effective. Senator Larry Craig (R-Idaho) proposed total repeal early in the 103rd Congress. He stated, "Given this President's [William Clinton] efforts to reduce the deficit," he suggested that one way to achieve budget cuts could be by equalizing federal and private construction standards. In March 1993, President Clinton issued Proclamation No. 6534, restoring the full force of the Davis-Bacon Act without providing an explanation.  The 1992-1993 suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act had been proposed by policy advisors long before Hurricanes Iniki struck. President Bush's initial reaction was reported to be mixed. Whether his decision to suspend the act was influenced primarily by storm-related events or broader policy considerations remains unclear. However, several questions persist regarding the scope and intent of the law. Specifically, what qualifies as a "national emergency" for suspending the Davis-Bacon Act? Can the President suspend the act in response to regional emergencies with limited national impact, such as earthquakes or floods?
The presidential authority to suspend the Davis-Bacon Act extends beyond just the Act itself; it could potentially cover other program statutes where Davis-Bacon provisions are incorporated. In regions with state and local prevailing wage requirements, how might a presidential suspension impact these regulations? If a President were to suspend the act, for how long could such a suspension remain in effect? Historically, such suspensions have been brief, but they could theoretically persist as long as the suspending president remains in office. Legal challenges are likely, especially if the duration of any suspension is extended.  The Davis-Bacon Act remained contentious throughout much of the 1990s. Despite some aspects of the Reagan-era changes being unresolved, particularly the "helper" issue, questions persisted regarding wage rate determinations. Meanwhile, calls for both repeal and reinforcement of the statute were heard frequently in Congress. With the 1994 election, Republicans gained control of both houses, making Davis-Bacon a top priority. Bills supporting or opposing the act were introduced, with Engineering News-Record summarizing: "Senate and House Republicans are planning simultaneous challenges to the 64-year-old federal prevailing-wage law through two bills aimed at its repeal." Clearly defined battle lines emerged. On one side, lawmakers and interest groups pushed for immediate repeal, while on the other, labor and industry groups were prepared to discuss comprehensive reform. Committees swiftly scheduled hearings, with some predicting decisive action: significant statute modification or possibly something more substantial.  On January 4, 1995, Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.), who had become the new chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, introduced S. 141, a straightforward proposal to repeal both the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts.
Senator Kassebaum described the Davis-Bacon Act as "outmoded," arguing that it "ill-serves" the public through its "wage rate and work rule restrictions." A hearing was held on February 15, followed by a mark-up session and the bill's referral to be reported on March 29. Meanwhile, House legislation emerged with Representative Cass Ballenger (R-N.C.) introducing H.R. 500 on January 13, 1995. This proposed not only repealing the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts but also removing Davis-Bacon requirements from all federal laws where they were incorporated. Ballenger claimed that the act "adds billions of dollars to Federal construction costs," and that repeal would enable lower wages for workers, allowing the government to fund more projects or complete planned ones with saved funds.  The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, chaired by Representative Ballenger. On March 2, the subcommittee marked up the bill and reported it to the full Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. While it appeared momentum was building for repeal, support was not entirely clear-cut. Lines were neither sharply nor uniformly drawn along party lines.  On August 11, 1995, Senator Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), chair of the Appropriations Committee, introduced S. 1183, the "Davis-Bacon Act Reform Amendments of 1995," with five other Republican Senators. Hatfield presented this legislation as a compromise acceptable to both major parties: construction trade unions and contractors' coalitions. He recalled that as Governor of Oregon, he had signed his state's "little Davis-Bacon Act" and affirmed his support for the prevailing wage concept, stating that "the Davis-Bacon Act, as it now stands, indeed deserves some of the criticism that my distinguished associates level against it."
Despite its primary goal of protecting the jobs of our nation's construction workers, the purpose should drive us toward reform rather than repeal of the act. Senator Hatfield explained that the bill was the result of extensive discussions among industry and labor representatives in Oregon during 1995, which continued in Washington that summer. He proposed three key amendments: raising the threshold for federal projects from $2,000 to $100,000, changing the frequency of wage and benefit filings from weekly to monthly, and excluding trainees and apprentices if they are enrolled in a Department of Labor-registered training program.  The bill included additional provisions such as tightening certain requirements and expanding or redefining coverage. Hatfield argued that S. 1183 would revise Davis-Bacon "to serve its original and commendable purpose."  As the summer of 1995 progressed, consideration of the Davis-Bacon act continued while Congress addressed budget and appropriations measures and various program statutes. On October 12, Representative Curt Weldon (R-Pa.) introduced H.R. 2472 as companion legislation to Hatfield’s bill. Initially proposed by Republican Members of the House, it garnered support from 27 Republicans and received backing from organized labor and major contracting corporations across America. Weldon asserted that repealing Davis-Bacon would jeopardize the quality of life for every construction worker in the country.  Both S. 1183 and H.R. 2472 failed to pass as the 104th Congress concluded, effectively halting the movement for repeal of the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts.
It was reported that when repeal seemed imminent, over 14,000 contractors joined a coalition with construction unions advocating for reform rather than outright repeal. Throughout the late 20th century, despite continued introduction of repeal proposals, these were not acted upon. Limited oversight hearings were conducted, but Congress focused primarily on the Davis-Bacon provisions within program statutes. No changes were made to the prevailing wage statute. In late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina intensified in the Caribbean and approached Florida and the Gulf Coast, resulting in one of the greatest natural disasters in U.S. history. As the impact was assessed, New Orleans bore the brunt of the disaster. Public and private funding was made available to affected areas, but thousands were displaced, often relocating to other states.  Representative George Miller, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, observed, "Year after year, Republicans have tried to erase this law [the Davis-Bacon Act]... But they do not have the votes in Congress to do it." However, Hurricane Katrina may have changed the dynamics. A Washington Post headline from September 10, 2005, read, "In the Floods, Parties' Agendas Surface."  Before the hurricane, large pockets of poverty existed in the New Orleans area. As the city was evacuated ahead of the storm, many poor residents lacked resources and transportation, with few suitable destinations available. After the storm passed, many poor remained amidst the ruins of a once-thriving city, still resourceless but now without homes or jobs.  On September 7, when Budget Director Joshua Bolten briefed House Republicans on the President's supplemental spending request, conservative lawmakers urged him to lift wage rules tied to Davis-Bacon. That same day, Representatives Tom Feeney (R-FL), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Marilyn Musgrave (R-CO) organized a letter to President George W. Bush.
President Bush was urging him to use his presidential authority to waive Davis-Bacon Act requirements. In a letter signed by 35 House members, they affirmed that compliance with the wage standards of the Davis-Bacon Act could delay reconstruction and potentially increase total construction costs by up to 38%. The letter called for suspending the act: "Given the massive rebuilding challenges ahead, we respectfully urge you to make a presidential proclamation to suspend the Davis-Bacon Act until our country is once again whole." On September 8, 2005, President Bush suspended the Davis-Bacon Act for specific regions—Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. He specified that this suspension applied to both the act itself and "the provisions of all other acts providing for wage payments" under Davis-Bacon rules, with the suspension continuing until otherwise provided.  Representative Charlie Norwood (R-GA) praised the President's "swift action to remove unnecessary bureaucracy that may hinder our recovery." He stated that the Davis-Bacon rules are burdensome and increase project costs. Noting that "the nation cannot afford such inefficiency and inflated costs," he emphasized the need for efficient rebuilding efforts funded by taxpayers. The Daily Labor Report quoted the President as saying this suspension would provide greater assistance to devastated communities and allow for the employment of thousands more workers. Representative Feeney reportedly stated, "Many people in Louisiana are ready to work tomorrow, and market forces will set wages."  Organized labor countered that the President's order might permit contractors to pay substandard wages to construction workers in affected areas. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney expressed concern that employers would exploit workers.
This is not the moment to make it easier. Moreover, he stated that exploiting a national tragedy to eliminate worker protections, which corporate supporters of the White House have long desired to remove, amounts to profiteering. Edward Sullivan, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department, compared this to "legalized looting." The New York Times editorial noted that by any standard of human decency, condemning many already poor and bereaved individuals to sub-par wages, thereby perpetuating their poverty, is unacceptable.  Representative Flake introduced the Cleanup and Reconstruction Enhancement Act (CARE Act) on September 7, 2005, anticipating the President's action. The CARE Act (H.R. 3684), when a "major disaster" has been declared under the Stafford Act, would automatically suspend the Davis-Bacon Act for one year in the affected area. A companion bill, S. 1817, was introduced by Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC).  Following the President's action, several bills were proposed to overturn his Davis-Bacon proclamation: H.R. 3763 (George Miller), H.R. 3834 (Frank Pallone, D-NJ), and S. 1739 (Edward Kennedy, D-MA). Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced a two-pronged bill (S. 1763): first, to give employment preference to workers displaced by Hurricane Katrina; second, to restore the impact of the Davis-Bacon Act in areas where it had been suspended.  Additionally, legislation addressing the Davis-Bacon Act included Representative Miller's H.Res. 467, which requested information on contracts related to wages and benefits for workers recovering from Hurricane Katrina. This bill was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce but ultimately rejected by a vote of 25 to 20.
A similar measure was proposed by Representative Steve LaTourette (R-OH) and referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, chaired by Alaska’s Representative Young. As conditions in the Gulf region became clearer, there emerged a push for reinstating the Davis-Bacon Act. In late September, approximately 37 Republicans signed a letter to President Bush, urging him to rescind his proclamation suspending the act. LaTourette highlighted that when the Davis-Bacon Act is suspended, so are its Copeland Anti-Kickback prohibitions, resulting in "no more certified payrolls." He added that reinstating the act would be beneficial for those concerned about profiteering.  In late October, around 20 Republicans met with White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card at Speaker Dennis Hastert’s office. Card was described as receptive to their suggestions and acknowledged that suspending the act did not save money. On October 25, Card contacted LaTourette to invite him to a meeting at the White House the following day. During this meeting, Card reportedly stated, according to LaTourette, that "there appeared to be no savings from suspending the Davis-Bacon Act."  On October 26, 2005, it was reported that a policy change was imminent; by late afternoon, confirmation seemed likely. The Bush Administration announced that they would reinstate Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements for reconstruction projects in hurricane-affected Gulf Coast regions on November 8. Labor Secretary Elaine Chao stated that "upon review of current conditions in the declared areas, the administration will reinstate Davis-Bacon."  Despite its long-standing presence—75 years—the Davis-Bacon Act continues to be a source of controversy.
During the late 20th century and early 21st centuries, while aspects of its administration continue to be disputed, most controversies trace back to legislation enacted in 1931 and 1935. Initially, there was little doubt that the Department of Labor could easily determine prevailing wages when stakeholders—employers and workers—could not agree on local wage rates. However, wage rate determination has remained a central issue under the Davis-Bacon Act and remains unresolved to this day.  Similarly, worker classification has also been contentious, particularly with proposals in the late 1970s regarding "helpers" and apprentices. The way workers are classified significantly impacts their pay rates and can reflect an employer's stance on trade unions and collective bargaining. Other classification issues have arisen alongside the interpretation of statutory provisions. For instance, what constitutes the "site of work" for Davis-Bacon purposes? How should "off-site" work be treated? Should truck drivers fall under Davis-Bacon coverage? Additionally, there are ongoing debates about the relationship between the Davis-Bacon Act and other procurement statutes, such as the Walsh-Healey Act (setting labor standards for goods produced under federal contracts) and the McNamara-O'Hara Act (setting labor standards for service workers engaged under federal contracts).  Moreover, annexing the Davis-Bacon Act to various program statutes or including a Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provision in such statutes has introduced further complexities and opportunities for dispute. Whether adding a Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provision to a program statute ensures worker protection depends on the specific wording of coverage and its relationship to the core statute.
When project funding is provided indirectly via a revolving fund or tax credits rather than through appropriated funds, does Davis-Bacon coverage need to be modified or could the work be entirely exempt from it? Throughout the 1990s and beyond, disputes persisted regarding the economic impact of the Davis-Bacon Act. If the act were repealed, how much might federal agencies save by paying construction workers at lower rates? Alternatively, would eliminating Davis-Bacon result in increased labor or total project costs due to other implications? Does Davis-Bacon, with its associated regulations, foster higher workmanship quality, enhanced productivity, and a reduced need for remedial work? Is there a connection between apprenticeship training and the benefits of Davis-Bacon? How do various groups—women, minorities, unskilled workers, and non-union employees—fare under the act's provisions?  After 75 years, as one peruses the hearings and floor discussions, it appears that the verdict remains unclear. There is also a notable lack of solid data to support such assessments. The issue of Davis-Bacon continues to be raised in Congress with largely unqualified assertions, often lacking empirical evidence.  Since the 1930s, doubts have been expressed about the necessity of the Davis-Bacon Act and the Department of Labor's ability to implement it reasonably. For much of its history, such criticism was relatively muted. In the 1950s, as Davis-Bacon provisions were increasingly included in program statutes, critics became more vocal. This trend intensified through the 1960s to the 1980s. In the mid-1990s, there seemed to be some indication that critics might be making progress towards its repeal or significant revision. However, by the late 1990s, public sentiment shifted, and debate on the act cooled, although criticism has not entirely disappeared.  The act has been the subject of numerous hearings, scores of floor debates, and a substantial body of literature including studies, reports, and analyses.
The thrust of congressional policy has consistently aimed at expanding coverage and strengthening the Davis-Bacon Act. Over the years, certain policy issues concerning the act have remained under discussion, and these unresolved questions continue to provoke debates, often similar to those from the 1930s. The ongoing discourse and literature on both sides of the issue, while extensive, do not provide new insights into critical aspects of the act, its administration, or its impact.  The Davis-Bacon Act is now an integral part of wage structures and contracting practices within the construction industry. The potential impacts of repealing or significantly modifying the act are unclear. Furthermore, should any changes to Davis-Bacon be extended to related Federal contract labor standards statutes—such as the Walsh-Healey and McNamara-O'Hara Acts—the implications could be substantial. Further study in this area might prove beneficial.  As we move into the 21st century, several additional factors may influence or reshape debates over the Davis-Bacon Act. First, there is a perception of a gradual weakening of trade unions—both in terms of membership and political influence. This could result in reduced public and congressional support for the act, potentially altering labor's legislative priorities.  Simultaneously, it should be noted that the primary intent of the Davis-Bacon Act was to ensure stability within the construction industry while protecting labor standards. The elimination of this act might have adverse effects, such as creating uncertainties regarding wages during bidding processes, altering manpower utilization patterns, increasing workplace accidents, and impacting skill development programs.  Secondly, there has been a gradual demographic change over time, which could also impact the debate on the Davis-Bacon Act.
On May 26, 1994, the U.S. Occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934 is discussed. In the early 20th century, Haiti faced a turbulent political climate and chronic financial mismanagement, with 80% of its budget allocated to debt service. This left U.S. officials concerned about potential non-payment of debts to American citizens. Additionally, there was fear that a warring European country, particularly France or Germany, might establish a presence in Haiti, which could threaten access to the newly constructed Panama Canal via naval bases.  These concerns escalated following World War I when Haitian authority broke down into bloody factional struggles in the summer of 1915. The Woodrow Wilson administration decided to intervene. In July 1915, Admiral William B. Caperton led a landing party of approximately 330 sailors and marines onto Haiti's capital within hours with minimal resistance; only two U.S. fatalities were reported, possibly from friendly fire, and Haitian casualties were also low.  Admiral Caperton directed additional forces to control other coastal areas, suppressing guerrilla resistance in mountainous regions by mid-November. By the end of 1915, the marine presence was reduced to about 100 officers and 1,600 enlisted men. Despite sporadic uprisings from 1918 to 1920, most marines were assigned garrison duties with some countryside patrols.  Once established in major population centers, U.S. officials ensured the election of an agreeable president, Philippe Sudre Dartiguenave, who had previously served as President of the Haitian Senate. Ongoing unrest led to the implementation of censorship and martial law by Admiral Caperton, which remained in effect for over a decade.  To ensure stability, the United States proposed a treaty allowing a U.S.-appointed official to handle tax collection, debt repayment, and other disbursements, effectively integrating Haiti's financial system with American oversight.
The treaty, ratified by Haiti in November 1915 and by the U.S. Senate the following February, established a constabulary (or gendarmerie) comprising native Haitians under American direction to serve as both military and police forces. The treaty was set to remain effective for ten years, with an option for another ten-year extension if its objectives were not fully achieved. In March 1917, the duration of the 1915 treaty was officially extended to twenty years.  Despite this, the Haitian National Assembly proved uncooperative in dealings with U.S. officials. The State Department drafted a new Haitian Constitution that would legitimize the occupation and allow foreigners to own property in Haiti. However, the assembly refused to ratify it, leading to its dissolution when Lt. Col. Smedley D. Butler, a U.S. Marine officer serving with the Haitian Gendarmerie, entered the capital in June 1917 and read an order dissolving the assembly, which Dartiguenave had been pressured into signing.  To avoid risking another election for the Assembly, U.S. authorities approved the new constitution by plebiscite in June 1918, with only 769 negative votes out of 100,000. The new constitution created a Council of State, appointed by the Haitian president to handle legislative functions until an Assembly could be reconstituted at a later date.  While U.S. forces occupied the country's main towns, guerrilla bands known as cacos—named after a local bird of prey—remained active in the mountainous interior. These groups, long influential in Haitian politics and sometimes fighting for various factions among the dominant francophone elite, launched renewed attacks in October 1918. These attacks persisted until the marines and Gendarmerie neutralized them through frequent patrols, offering bounties for surrendered weapons, and eliminating their leaders.  After 1920, there were only sporadic outbreaks of caco violence. The Gendarmerie, renamed the Garde d'Haiti in 1928, became a crucial part of Haiti's administrative structure, initially officered by Americans—largely enlisted marines—who were paid by the U.S.
The Gendarmerie, numbering between 2,000 and 2,600 members, was deployed across Haiti from the Marine Corps and assumed key roles such as maintaining law and order, resolving disputes, and supporting public works projects. It also served as Haiti's military force. Gradually, U.S. officers were replaced by Haitians, a process that accelerated after 1929. Historians acknowledge that under U.S. occupation, Haitians enjoyed greater personal security and property safety than ever before, and the Gendarmerie functioned effectively and impartially during this period. After the U.S. forces withdrew in 1934, Haitian officers became much more involved in political activities.  Throughout the occupation, U.S. forces sustained minimal casualties—only 10 fatalities and 26 wounded (with 172 other incidents). Concerns about brutality against native Haitians led to Congressional hearings on Haiti and the Dominican Republic in 1922. The special committee rejected serious charges but acknowledged that most abuses occurred during the suppression of the caco insurrection from 1918 to 1919, resulting in the deaths of over 2,000 cacos.  Although it was affirmed that cruelty was not officially condoned, the committee noted at least ten instances of illegal executions by Americans. Once the caco rebellion was quelled, there were virtually no physical attacks on U.S. marines or civilians. Following the 1922 congressional investigation, which highlighted a lack of coordination among U.S. officials in Haiti, authority was consolidated.  From 1922 to 1930, General John H. Russell, USMC, served as both the senior Marine in Haiti and the U.S. High Commissioner, reporting directly to the State Department. His role included overseeing U.S. officials dealing with finance, public works, sanitation, agriculture, and the Gendarmerie chief. Described as a conscientious yet somewhat imperious officer, Russell became the most powerful figure in the country before being appointed Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps.  The Great Depression and declining markets for Haitian products, particularly coffee, exacerbated economic hardships and increased unrest among a population that had long been denied political participation. Riots in Les Cayes in December 1929 threatened to spread nationwide.
A detachment from the Marine Brigade in Port-au-Prince was sent to restore order, but a confrontation resulted in at least 12 Haitian deaths. Subsequent incidents ended without loss of life, yet the Hoover Administration feared that involvement in potential hostilities might not be supported by U.S. public opinion. In early 1930, President Hoover appointed a bipartisan commission, led by W. Cameron Forbes, former Governor General of the Philippines, to investigate conditions in Haiti.  After several weeks in the country, where testimony was gathered from all sectors of society, the commission submitted a report. It argued that the United States could not relinquish its responsibilities for ensuring Haiti's financial stability but proposed changes such as separating civil and military duties, increasing Haitian representation in government, and reducing U.S. intervention in domestic affairs.  In November, General Russell was replaced by Dana G. Munro, a State Department official, who was appointed Minister instead of High Commissioner. An Executive Agreement negotiated in 1932 called for the complete Haitianization of the Garde by October 1934 and the withdrawal of the Marine Brigade two years before the extended 1915 Treaty expired.  Despite this, Washington aimed to withdraw earlier. Arrangements were made for a temporary Haitian president election and national elections in October 1930, which resulted in a strongly nationalistic majority. The complete Haitianization of the Garde was completed. President Franklin Roosevelt paid an official visit to Cap-Haitien in July 1934, and the last marines departed the following month.  A U.S. financial adviser remained until 1941 to oversee payments on the Haitian debt. The U.S. occupation largely achieved its goals of stabilizing Haitian finances. Security for investors was a key concern for the U.S. Government, with the occupation justified by this once the threat of European intervention diminished at the end of World War I.  A $16-million U.S. loan was negotiated in 1922 to consolidate Haiti's outstanding foreign debts. Efficient duty collection and prompt payments restored the country's financial standing.
Under U.S. supervision, approximately 60% of Haiti's revenues were spent during the occupation, with a significant portion allocated to debt repayment. Some critics, including the Forbes Commission, argued that funds used for advanced debt repayment could have been better directed towards domestic projects. However, there is general consensus that Haitian finances were managed honestly and measures were taken to prevent foreign exploitation of the country.  In the 1920s, annual government revenues in Haiti doubled from pre-occupation levels to $8-10 million, with substantial growth in coffee production and small businesses. Nevertheless, little was achieved in establishing a robust, long-term economic foundation. The occupation led to the completion of numerous public works projects, particularly after 1920. Notably, extensive road construction and bridge building were carried out through a highly contentious system of forced labor or corvée. These roads, though not all paved, significantly improved transportation between coastal areas and rural uplands as automobiles and trucks became more common.  Public infrastructure was also enhanced with the establishment of port facilities, lighthouses, and harbor dredging. Efforts to boost agricultural productivity were hampered by small landholdings and inadequate legal titles. The U.S. initiated a significant initiative to provide modern healthcare to the largely unexposed Haitian population through the creation of a National Public Health Service with over 153 rural clinics and 11 hospitals, supervised by U.S. Navy doctors. Basic medical training was also provided to the populace, with funding encouraged by the Haitian government.  The United States did not seek to "build democracy," nor did it focus on promoting local self-government. Prior to the occupation, the Haitian government was dominated by a small elite comprising about 5% of the population.
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, established under Title XVI of the Social Security Act in 1972 and implemented in 1974, guarantees a minimum cash income to aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Eligible recipients, including couples, must have limited income and resources. For adults, disability is defined as an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or last at least 12 months; the worker must be unable to perform any kind of job available in the national economy, considering age, education, and work experience. Children under 18 may qualify if they have an impairment resulting in "marked and severe" functional limitations. Adults aged 65 or older can receive SSI benefits without being disabled.  SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and operates across the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. To qualify, an individual must be a U.S. citizen or a "qualified alien," resident in the United States or the Northern Mariana Islands, a child of a military member stationed outside the country, or a student temporarily abroad. Additional requirements include residency status, absence from the country, filing for other potential benefits, and meeting certain fugitive felon and probation/parole violator criteria.  As of December 2013, over 8.3 million people received SSI payments totaling more than $4.6 billion; among these, over 1.3 million were children under 18, nearly 5.0 million were adults between the ages of 18 and 64, and just over 2.1 million were adults aged 65 or older.  The maximum federal SSI payment, known as the federal benefit rate, was $721 per month for individuals living independently and $1,082 for couples in 2014.
All but six states and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands supplement federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits with additional payments. Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have state supplements administered by either the Social Security Administration (SSA) or self-administered by the states, while 34 states administer their own supplements independently. Federal SSI benefit maximums are annually adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), reflecting changes in the cost of living. In 2014, there was a 1.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) following a 1.7% increase in 2013.  Most SSI recipients also have other income which is subtracted from the federal benefit rate to determine their eligibility and payment amount. SSI accounts for certain income exclusions, such as the first $20 of monthly unearned income and the first $65 plus one-half of any remaining earned income. As of December 2013, the average federally administered SSI payment was $630.98 per month for children under 18, $546.38 for adults aged 18 to 64, and $425.09 for adults aged 65 or older.  SSA typically sends monthly SSI payments directly to recipients. However, representative payees are appointed for minors, individuals unable to manage their benefits due to physical or mental incapacity, and those declared legally incompetent by a court.  Solo living SSI recipients or household members who all receive SSI benefits are automatically eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Most SSI recipients also qualify for Medicaid. The SSI program considers various types of income in determining eligibility and payment amounts. In certain cases, non-recipient's income and resources may be deemed to determine SSI eligibility and benefit amounts, such as when an eligible child lives with an ineligible parent or an eligible individual lives with an ineligible spouse.
Hedge funds function similarly to unregulated mutual funds but operate with a more flexible structure. These are pools of invested capital that trade various assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign currencies, precious metals, commodities, and derivatives. While some hedge funds adhere to specific investment strategies (like focusing solely on mortgage bonds or East Asian stock markets), others known as macro funds invest globally wherever opportunities for profit arise.  To circumvent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, hedge funds accept investments only from "accredited investors," defined by the SEC as individuals with assets of at least $1 million. Additionally, they leverage exemptions provided by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which oversees public mutual funds but not hedge funds.  In contrast, mutual funds are subject to extensive regulations aimed at safeguarding small, unsophisticated investors. These rules include limitations on borrowing, stringent record-keeping and reporting requirements, capital structure stipulations, adherence to specific investment goals and strategies, bonding obligations, and the necessity of obtaining shareholder approval (through proxy solicitation) for certain operations. A mutual fund only needs 100 or more shareholders to be regulated; therefore, hedge funds typically limit their investor base to no more than 99 individuals.  The National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-290) allowed a broader exemption for hedge funds by permitting unlimited partners as long as each is a "qualified purchaser" with at least $5 million in total assets.  Hedge funds are often structured as limited partnerships, headed by general partners who also act as investment managers. Many of these managers were formerly employees of large securities firms, seeking greater entrepreneurial freedom and higher financial rewards. The potential earnings for hedge fund managers can be exceptionally high, even by Wall Street standards.
In addition to earning a return on their own capital, typical hedge fund managers receive 15%-25% of all profits generated by the fund and an annual management fee of 1%-2% of total assets under management. Data on hedge funds are available from several private sources, though estimates regarding the size of the hedge fund universe vary significantly. Prior to the 2007 financial crisis, there were approximately 8,000-9,000 hedge funds with around $2 trillion in assets under management. Many funds have since closed due to substantial losses during the bear markets of 2008; George Soros has estimated that the value of capital under management could shrink by up to 75%. Starting a hedge fund is relatively straightforward, and new managers can attract capital and thrive based on performance and management fees. Due to their tendency for risky investments in pursuit of high returns, hedge funds have a high failure rate: studies show an annual attrition rate of about 20%, with an average lifespan of around three years.  The average annual return earned by hedge funds varies; some research indicates they typically outperform common benchmarks such as the S&P 500, while other analyses suggest they lag behind. The short life span of many hedge funds creates measurement challenges, including survivorship bias: funds that close each year are not included in performance calculations. Annual returns can vary widely from one fund to another and year to year. According to the law of averages, at least a few funds will perform exceptionally well in any given period, which may contribute to their continued popularity among investors despite high fees and risks. Hedge funds are recognized as high-risk/high-return operations where investors must be prepared for potential losses. Investors who accept these risks often seek high returns or portfolio diversification benefits.
During market turmoil, attempting to liquidate assets and unwind derivative positions could lead to extreme price declines and heightened volatility, potentially harming firms not directly involved with Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). Critics of the Federal Reserve's intervention worried about moral hazard—the belief that too-big-to-fail entities might take unnecessary risks. However, the Fed prioritized preventing widespread financial market damage, which could extend to the real economy. Following this episode, systemic risk became a major policy concern for hedge funds. These funds can attract substantial capital from wealthy individuals and institutions and leverage it heavily through borrowing and derivatives, posing significant risks if they fail. While not all hedge funds engage in high-risk strategies or borrow extensively, many do, and similar large and complex positions could emerge elsewhere.  Systemic risk primarily involves the potential for failing funds to sell massive amounts of securities at a time when markets lack the liquidity to absorb them, causing market "seizures." Lenders, including federally insured banks, face serious losses if hedge funds default. LTCM highlighted uncertainties in evaluating risks associated with lending to hedge funds and raised questions about derivative contract defaults. The unregulated nature of derivatives further complicates oversight, while a lack of transparency regarding hedge fund portfolios and strategies exacerbates market panic.  In summary, the failure of LTCM underscores the potential dangers posed by hedge funds' systemic risk.
However, the success of these funds can also instill concerns among policymakers and regulators, especially in foreign exchange markets where manipulation by hedge funds has been linked to instability, such as during the European currency crises in the early 1990s and the Asian devaluations from 1997 to 1998. Hedge funds and other speculators can borrow a currency, sell it short, and profit if the currency depreciates, potentially putting pressure on foreign exchange reserves and leading to a devaluation. To defend against such pressures might require increasing domestic interest rates sharply, with negative consequences for the stock market and economic growth.  In the United States, where such speculative attacks have not been targeted, many argue that blaming hedge funds is akin to punishing those who merely bring bad news, suggesting that speculators often exploit weaknesses created by poor economic policies. The impact of speculation on price volatility remains a contentious issue in finance; while there has never been definitive proof that speculation causes volatility, the two phenomena are frequently observed together.  Hedge funds, being the most visible agents of speculation in today's global markets, are viewed with considerable suspicion by some regulators and market participants. In April 1999, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury Department, issued a report highlighting that the case of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) demonstrated how an overly leveraged institution can pose risks to other institutions and the financial system. The report also noted that proprietary trading operations by commercial and investment banks follow similar strategies in the same markets as hedge funds but are often much larger and more highly leveraged.  The overarching concern is thus how to mitigate excessive leverage. The Working Group concluded that increased disclosure of financial information from hedge funds would be beneficial.
The report suggested that large investment funds be required to publish annual disclosure statements with a "snapshot" of their portfolios and a comprehensive risk assessment. Public companies and financial institutions were also advised to include in their quarterly and annual reports a statement outlining their exposure to hedge funds and other highly leveraged entities.  In response to the rapid growth in hedge fund investments, the SEC staff recommended mandatory registration for hedge funds as investment advisers in 2003. The benefits of such registration included regular examinations by the SEC to detect and deter fraud early; the acquisition of essential information about hedge fund investments and strategies that may significantly impact markets; and the ability to require uniform standards and enhanced disclosures from registered hedge funds.  On October 26, 2004, the SEC adopted a rule mandating hedge fund registration under the Investment Advisers Act by a 3-2 vote. Opponents argued against this measure, claiming that investors in hedge funds are sophisticated enough to understand risks, that the SEC already has sufficient authority to address fraud, and that concerns about systemic risk are exaggerated. They also suggested that mutual funds should instead adopt hedge fund investment strategies.  Although the regulation was not as stringent as some critics had hoped, it did ensure that hedge funds would be subject to regular examinations by the SEC. The rule failed to provide real-time monitoring of hedge fund trading or prevent another potential crisis similar to Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). However, the SEC explicitly declined direct regulation, stating there was no justification for such oversight and that the rule had no intention of restricting how hedge funds invest or trade securities.  The rule took effect on February 1, 2006. Basic information on registering hedge funds became available on the SEC website.
On June 23, 2006, an appeals court ruled that the existing rule was arbitrary and incompatible with the Investment Advisers Act, vacating it and sending it back to the SEC for reconsideration. Chairman Cox directed the SEC’s professional staff to propose alternative options for the Commission's consideration.  Another issue involves the "retailization" of hedge funds. As previously noted, all fund investors must meet the criteria for an "accredited investor," requiring annual incomes of at least $200,000 or net worths of over $1 million (excluding their primary residence). Established in the 1980s, this threshold has been lowered due to a larger portion of the population now meeting these standards. The SEC is concerned that less sophisticated households might be investing in hedge funds, influenced by market developments such as the introduction of funds-of-hedge funds, which accept smaller investments than traditional funds.  This issue intersects with investor protection concerns where pension funds and other institutional investors are increasingly placing significant sums with hedge funds. Unsophisticated beneficiaries could potentially face substantial losses if fiduciaries are not prudent. On December 13, 2006, the SEC proposed raising the accredited investor threshold from $1 million to $2.5 million in assets (excluding the value of the home), aiming to significantly reduce the pool of potential hedge fund investors. However, this rule has yet to be finalized.  In February 2007, the President's Working Group issued an agreement among its members and U.S. authorities regarding these developments.
The document "Agency Principals on Principles and Guidelines Regarding Private Pools of Capital" asserts that policies promoting market discipline, participant awareness of risk, and prudent risk management are the most effective ways to protect investors and mitigate systemic risk. It does not advocate for legislation granting regulators new powers or authorities specifically for hedge fund regulation.  In December 2008, the discovery that Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, a firm registered with both the SEC as a broker-dealer and an investment adviser, had operated a massive Ponzi scheme highlighted concerns about market self-regulation's efficacy. Many hedge funds and funds-of-funds had entrusted billions of client dollars to Madoff without detecting the fraud.  The Obama Administration’s 2009 white paper, "Financial Regulatory Reform: A New Foundation," suggests that advisers managing hedge funds (and other private pools of capital like private equity and venture capital funds) with significant assets should be required to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. These advisers must provide sufficient information on their managed funds to assess potential threats to financial stability.  During the 109th Congress, the House passed H.R. 6079 (Representative Castle), directing the President's Working Group to examine hedge fund growth, associated risks, leverage usage, and benefits. The Senate did not act on this bill.  In the 111th Congress, H.R. 711 (Representatives Capuano and Castle) proposes removing the Investment Advisers Act’s exemption for firms with fewer than 15 clients, effective if a fund has more than $25 million in client funds, requiring such hedge funds to register with the SEC as investment advisers.  Additionally, H.R. 712 (Representative Castle) mandates defined benefit pension plans to disclose their investments in hedge funds.
Representative Castle's 713 directive instructs the President's Working Group on Financial Markets to conduct a study of the hedge fund industry and submit recommendations regarding regulation to Congress. Senator Grassley’s S. 344 limits existing exemptions under the Investment Company Act, mandating that hedge funds managing over $50 million register with the SEC.  S. 506 and H.R. 1265 modify the tax treatment of offshore funds, while S. 1276 requires managers of hedge funds to register as investment advisers, private equity firms, and venture capital funds, authorizing the SEC to gather systemic risk data from them.  Hedge funds are not considered a primary cause of the financial crisis that began in 2007; however, they are viewed as part of the "shadow" financial system encompassing over-the-counter derivatives, non-bank lending, and other lightly or unregulated sectors. As part of comprehensive regulatory reform legislation under consideration by the House and Senate during the 111th Congress, certain hedge funds would be required to register with the SEC and disclose their positions and trading strategies to systemic risk authorities.  Under H.R. 4173, passed by the House on December 11, 2009, managers of funds with more than $150 million under management must register as investment advisers with the SEC. They would submit confidential portfolio information relevant to the Federal Reserve or other systemic risk authorities. The bill offers exemptions for advisers to venture capital funds and small business investment corporations (SBICs).  Senator Dodd’s Restoring American Financial Stability Act, reported by the Senate Banking Committee on March 22, 2010, includes similar registration and reporting requirements. It sets a SEC registration threshold of $100 million in assets under management for all investment advisers, with those below this figure registering with state authorities. Venture capital funds, private equity funds, and SBICs are exempted from these provisions.
This statute stipulates: "The Secretary of the military department concerned may make a military animal from such department available for adoption under the following circumstances: (1) At the end of the animal's useful life. (2) Before the end of the animal's useful life, if such Secretary determines that unusual or extraordinary circumstances justify it. (3) When the animal is otherwise surplus to the needs of such military department." The statute defines "military animal" as either a "military working dog" or a "horse owned by the Department of Defense." Initially enacted in 2000, this law applied solely to military working dogs; prior to that, these dogs were typically caged for periods extending up to a year and then euthanized under DoD policy. The statute was later amended in 2006 to include horses.  Additionally, the statute establishes an African Elephant Conservation Fund from which the Secretary of the Interior may provide financial assistance "for approved projects for research, conservation, management, or protection of African elephants." It mandates that the Secretary impose a moratorium on the importation of raw and worked ivory from countries not meeting specific criteria, including being a party to CITES (Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and adhering to the CITES Ivory Control System.  The act also imposes civil and criminal penalties for various activities, such as importing raw ivory from non-ivory producing countries or from those under a moratorium. Similarly, it penalizes anyone exporting raw ivory from the United States. Individuals providing information leading to a successful civil penalty or criminal conviction may receive up to one-half of any resulting fine or $25,000, whichever is less.  Section 794 of P.L.
Effective 120 days after the enactment of this act, none of the funds made available by it may be used to pay salaries or expenses for personnel inspecting horses under section 3 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 603) or under guidelines issued under section 903 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 1901 note; P.L. 104-127). Because the Federal Meat Inspection Act, 21 U.S.C. § 603, mandates the inspection of horses before they can be slaughtered for human consumption, section 794 of Public Law 109-97 would have effectively prohibited horse slaughter from March 10, 2006, to September 30, 2006. However, on February 8, 2006, the Department of Agriculture issued a regulation allowing slaughter plants to pay for inspections by the Food Safety and Inspection Service, enabling horses to continue being slaughtered for human consumption (9 C.F.R. § 352.19).  The 110th Congress prevented the Department of Agriculture from charging slaughter plants for these inspections, effectively prohibiting horse slaughter for human consumption. To achieve this, they prohibited appropriated funds from paying salaries and expenses under both the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, as well as from implementing or enforcing 9 C.F.R. § 352.19. Public Law 110-161 (§ 741) and Public Law 110-329, Division A (§ 101), incorporated these provisions.  Additionally, this statute criminalizes shooting any bird, fish, or other animal while in an aircraft, as well as using an aircraft to harass such animals.
These prohibitions do not apply to individuals employed by or licensed by a state or the federal government for activities related to "land, water, wildlife, domesticated animals, human life, or crops." According to Sections 1313-1314 of this act (16 U.S.C. §§ 3201-3202), the Secretary of the Interior can designate zones within Alaska's national preserves where hunting, fishing, trapping, and entry are prohibited. Additionally, these sections prohibit the taking of fish and wildlife in national parks or national park system monuments in Alaska, with exceptions detailed in the act.  Section 1005 of this act (amended in 1990; 16 U.S.C. § 3145) mandates that the Secretary of the Interior collaborate closely with the State of Alaska and Native Village and Regional Corporations to assess the impact of oil and gas exploration, development, production, transportation, and other human activities on wildlife resources, including those in Arctic and Porcupine caribou herds, polar bears, muskoxen, grizzly bears, wolves, wolverines, seabirds, shorebirds, and migratory waterfowl.  This statute (along with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 791-794) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, public services, and public accommodations. Discrimination includes refusing reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities; such accommodations generally include allowing service animals like guide dogs. See, e.g., 28 C.F.R. § 36.302(c). Also see the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604.  This statute authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to take various actions for the protection of fishery resources. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct investigations, experiments, and tests as needed to determine, demonstrate, and promulgate effective methods of eradicating or controlling mountain lions, wolves, bobcats, prairie dogs, gophers, ground squirrels, jack rabbits, brown tree snakes, and other animals that are detrimental to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, animal husbandry, wild game animals, fur-bearing animals, and birds. This statute was enacted in 1931, with "brown tree snakes" added in 1991.
The statute defines an "animal enterprise" as follows:  (A) a commercial or academic entity that uses or sells animals or animal products for profit, food production, agriculture, education, research, or testing;  (B) a zoo, aquarium, animal shelter, pet store, breeder, furrier, circus, rodeo, or other lawful competitive event involving animals; or  (C) any fair or similar event aimed at advancing agricultural arts and sciences.  This statute allows the Secretary of Agriculture to prohibit or restrict the importation or exportation of animals into or from the United States, the movement of animals in interstate commerce, and the use of conveyances associated with livestock entry, if necessary to prevent pest or disease introduction. The Secretary may also order the destruction, removal, seizure, quarantine, or disposal of any animal under similar circumstances.  Additionally, the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish standards for the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation of animals by dealers, research facilities, and exhibitors. These standards must include provisions to minimize animal pain and distress during experimental procedures.  The AWA also mandates that the Secretary develop standards governing the transport in commerce and care of animals by intermediate handlers, air carriers, or other carriers, ensuring humane treatment for consigned animals.  The definition of "animal" under the AWA encompasses any warm-blooded animal used for research, testing, experimentation, exhibition purposes, or as a pet. However, it excludes birds, rats of the genus Rattus, and mice of the genus Mus bred for research, horses not used for research, and other farm animals.
Section 2131 et seq.) of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) does not appear to have been reported on. The AWA mandates that every research facility establish an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee consisting of at least three members, with at least one member who is not affiliated with the facility and represents "general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals." This committee's responsibilities include reviewing practices involving pain to animals and filing a report with the Secretary. (7 U.S.C. § 2143(b)). Additionally, the AWA regulates dealers and exhibitors by licensing them (7 U.S.C. § 2133) and prohibiting research facilities from purchasing dogs or cats from unlicensed sources (7 U.S.C. § 2137).   The act defines "dealer" as a person who transports, buys, or sells animals for compensation, including those used for research, teaching, exhibition, or as pets, but excludes retail pet stores that do not sell to these facilities. (7 U.S.C. § 2132(f)). It also classifies an "exhibitor" as carnivals, circuses, and zoos, excluding retail pet stores, state and country fairs, livestock shows, rodeos, and purebred dog and cat shows. (7 U.S.C. § 2132(h)).  Moreover, the AWA forbids dealers and exhibitors from selling or otherwise disposing of any dog or cat within five business days after acquisition, except for auction sales operators. (7 U.S.C. § 2135). A 1990 amendment requires public and private pounds and shelters, as well as USDA-licensed research facilities, to hold and care for acquired dogs or cats for at least five days before sale to a dealer. (7 U.S.C. § 2158(a)). Does this provision preclude such entities from euthanizing a dog or cat before the five-day period?
The 2008 revision of § 14207(b) increased the maximum penalty for violations to a fine and up to five years in prison. The animal fighting section of the Animal Welfare Act also bans knowingly using interstate commerce, including mail services, to advertise animals or sharp instruments for an animal fighting event, or to promote such events, but this prohibition applies only to live bird fights where it would be illegal under state law.  The statute prohibits any U.S. citizen from engaging in commercial trade of native Antarctic animals and birds unless authorized by the National Science Foundation Director. This aligns with the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, making it unlawful to harvest or engage in commerce involving marine life taken in violation of this convention.  It establishes the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund, directing the Interior Secretary to allocate funds for conservation projects benefiting Asian elephants. Additionally, the statute mandates that the Commerce and Interior Secretaries collaborate with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to develop a program supporting interstate fishery management efforts.  The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Convention is implemented by limiting salmon fishing under this statute. Furthermore, it directs both Commerce and Interior Secretaries to declare a moratorium on Atlantic striped bass fishing within coastal waters of states that do not adhere to the fisheries management plan set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.  Lastly, the statute empowers the Commerce Secretary to create regulations aimed at restricting the size of fish caught and the quantity taken from each designated area.
The Agriculture Secretary is authorized by Section 1184 of the 1996 statute to issue guidelines for regulating the commercial transportation of equine for slaughter, particularly concerning food, water, rest provided in transit, segregation of stallions from other equines, and additional issues deemed relevant. Implementing regulations were issued in 2001 under 9 C.F.R. Part 88.  Section 8019 of P.L. 101-511 (1990) stipulates that funds appropriated by this Act may not be used for training Department of Defense students or personnel in surgical or medical treatment using dogs or cats, unless standards comply with Federal Animal Welfare Law and civilian medical practices. This provision originated from Section 791 of P.L. 98-212 (1984) but was modified to include "or hereafter," which ensures the prohibition remains effective.  Other Department of Defense appropriations statutes use phrases like “this Act or any other act,” as in P.L. 103-139, § 8044 (1993). The Comptroller General has interpreted such language to extend provisions throughout a fiscal year without implying future applicability.
Section 8034 of Public Law 104-61 (1995) states that no funds provided in this or any other act shall be used to conduct bone trauma research at any Army Research Laboratory until the Secretary of the Army certifies that the synthetic compound used will yield significant medical findings, the research has military applications, it adheres to animal care and use committee standards, and it does not duplicate existing research. Additionally, certain limitations on Department of Defense funds for animal research were specified in particular appropriations statutes. For instance, Section 8043 of Public Law 103-139 (1993) and Section 8032 of Public Law 104-61 (1995) stipulate that no funds appropriated by these acts shall be used for payments under the Department of Defense contract with Louisiana State University Medical Center involving cat research on Brain Missile Wounds.   Furthermore, Public Law 102-394, Section 213 (1992), prohibits the use of any funds from this act or subsequent Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Acts by the National Institutes of Health or other Federal agencies, or recipients of Federal funds, on projects involving the capture or procurement of chimpanzees obtained from the wild. The term "recipient of Federal funds" includes private citizens, corporations, or research institutions outside the United States that receive such funds. This provision was previously included in Public Laws 101-166, Section 214 (1989); 101-517, Section 211 (1990); and 102-170, Section 213 (1991).
Section 106-152 (1999) criminalizes knowingly creating, selling, or possessing visual or audio depictions of animal cruelty for commercial gain in interstate or foreign commerce, with exceptions for depictions that have serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value. The statute targeted "crush video" films depicting the crushing death of small animals. A federal court of appeals ruled this statute violated the First Amendment, and the Supreme Court has agreed to review the case (United States v. Stevens, 533 F.3d 218 (3d Cir. 2008), cert. granted, No. 08-769 (Apr. 20, 2009)). This statute is also known as the "Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act" and the "Fish Restoration and Management Projects Act." It directs the Secretary of the Interior to cooperate with state fish and game departments for fish restoration and management projects.  The New England Fishery Resources Restoration Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. § 777e-1) is included, and this statute was amended by the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000.  Additionally, P.L. 106-476, sections 1441-1443 (2000), prohibits importing or exporting dog or cat fur products into or from the United States, as well as engaging in interstate commerce with such products.  Furthermore, this statute was amended by §5 of the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act.
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 45, prohibits any producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or seller of tuna products exported from or offered for sale in the United States from using the term "dolphin safe" or any other term or symbol that falsely claims or suggests that the tuna were harvested without harming dolphins, unless the product contains tuna that meet the requirements for being considered dolphin safe under paragraph (2). Specifically, this includes tuna harvested on the high seas by a vessel engaged in driftnet fishing; outside the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using purse seine nets; or in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by a vessel using a purse seine net. Violators face a civil penalty of up to $100,000.  This statute also notes that long plastic driftnets can result in significant entanglement and death of marine resources, including dolphins, in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. Therefore, it directs the Secretary of Commerce, through the Secretary of State, to negotiate with foreign governments for monitoring driftnet fishing and evaluating methods to reduce lost or discarded driftnets.  Additionally, the Driftnet Act Amendments of 1990 (16 U.S.C. § 1826) build upon the provisions of the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 by making it unlawful to fish for designated species of tuna within the "Area Agreement" without a license or in violation of regulations set by the Secretary of Commerce.  Furthermore, this statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (or the Secretary of Commerce for marine mammals) to list endangered and threatened species and designate their critical habitats.
Discrimination based on handicap can include a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services that may be necessary for a handicapped person to use and enjoy a dwelling. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has determined that allowing seeing eye dogs is considered a reasonable accommodation. The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which oversees this statute, adopted a policy statement aimed at minimizing animal testing and reducing associated pain. This statement notes that neither the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) nor the Commission's regulations require mandatory animal tests, though it acknowledges that such tests may be necessary in some cases.  Additionally, it is a crime to willfully and maliciously harm a dog or horse used by a federal agency for law enforcement. This statute also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to approve state conservation plans for nongame fish and wildlife, defined as wild vertebrate animals that are not ordinarily taken for sport, fur, or food; are not listed as endangered species or threatened species; and are not marine mammals. An amendment in 1988 (16 U.S.C. § 2912) required the Secretary to conduct research and conservation activities related to population trends of migratory nongame birds and their environmental impacts.  Furthermore, this statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide assistance to federal, state, and public or private agencies in developing, protecting, rearing, and stocking all species of wildlife, conserving their resources and habitats, controlling losses due to disease or other causes, minimizing damages from overabundant species, and providing public shooting and fishing areas.
In addition to several amendments to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975, this statute also includes the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act, which this report summarizes separately. The statute funds research aimed at enhancing our understanding of agricultural production systems with six key purposes, one of which is to promote animal welfare.  Furthermore, the act prohibits the "taking" (which includes harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing) of fur seals in the North Pacific Ocean or on any lands or waters under U.S. jurisdiction and also restricts commerce involving fur seals' skins taken contrary to this act or the Interim Convention on the Conservation of North Pacific Fur Seals. An exception is made for "Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos who dwell on the coasts of the North Pacific Ocean," allowing them to take fur seals for educational, scientific, or exhibition purposes. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to permit such takings under these circumstances.  Additionally, the act directs the Secretary to manage fur seal rookeries on the Pribilof Islands to ensure activities there align with conservation, management, and protection goals for North Pacific fur seals and other wildlife.   The 1983 amendments to this statute repealed the Protection of Sea Otters on the High Seas Act (formerly sections 1171-1172 of title 16, U.S.C.), deeming it unnecessary due to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.  Furthermore, the act established the Great Ape Conservation Fund within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for using this fund on projects approved for great ape conservation.  Lastly, this statute criminalizes the exhibition or transportation for exhibition purposes of any "sore" horse—defined as a horse with injured feet that alter its gait.
The Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for enforcing the Horse Protection Act, which stipulates that no horse may be exported by sea from the United States or its territories or possessions unless a waiver has been granted by the Secretary of Commerce. Such waivers are permissible only if the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, determines that none of the horses in the consignment will be slaughtered.  The central provision of the Humane Slaughter Act (HSA) mandates that any method of slaughter or handling for slaughtering must be deemed humane and comply with U.S. public policy. The act specifies two humane methods:  (a) All livestock, including cattle, calves, horses, mules, sheep, swine, and others, are rendered insensible to pain by a single blow, gunshot, electrical, chemical means, or another rapid and effective method before being shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut; or (b) Slaughter in accordance with the ritual requirements of religious faiths that prescribe humane methods involving loss of consciousness through severance of the carotid arteries.  The Humane Slaughter Act is enforced by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. § 603(b), 610(b), and 620(a)). It does not apply to chickens or other birds. In 2002, a provision was added directing the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a report on practices involving nonambulatory livestock ("downed animals") to Congress (P.L. 107-171, § 10815, 7 U.S.C. § 1907).
This statute authorized the Secretary to promulgate regulations based on the findings of a report to ensure humane treatment of animals. It mandates that the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) review and evaluate new test methods, facilitate interagency and international harmonization of toxicological test protocols to reduce, refine, or replace animal testing, and consist of the heads (or their designees) of 15 federal agencies plus any other agency that develops, employs tests using animals, or regulates based on animal toxicity testing. The statute amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, and the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988, as detailed in this report. It also made it a crime to willfully disturb or kill birds, fish, or wild animals, take or destroy their eggs or nests on federally designated sanctuaries, refuges, or breeding grounds (18 U.S.C.).
Section 41) (2) prohibits the importation of species of wild animals, wild birds, fish (including mollusks and crustaceans), amphibians, reptiles, or their offspring or eggs if these are deemed injurious to human beings or to agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or wildlife by regulation of the Secretary of the Interior. Exceptions exist for zoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes (18 U.S.C. § 42). Section 3) makes it unlawful to use aircraft or motor vehicles to hunt wild unbranded horses, mares, colts, or burros running at large on public lands, or to pollute their watering holes (18 U.S.C. § 47). P.L. 110-161, § 109, amended in 2007, allows the Secretary of the Interior to use helicopters or motor vehicles for capturing and transporting horses and burros on the Sheldon and Hart National Wildlife Refuge under humane procedures prescribed by the Secretary.  The statute, as amended in 1988, bans commerce involving fish, wildlife, or plants taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of treaties, federal or state laws, regulations, or Indian tribal laws. The Captive Wildlife Safety Act, P.L. 108-191 (2003), broadened this to include "prohibited wildlife species," defined as live lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars, or cougars and their hybrids. However, this act excludes licensed exhibitors (zoos, circuses, etc.) and research facilities, as well as sanctuaries, humane societies, animal shelters, or anti-cruelty societies that meet certain criteria.  Additionally, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006, P.L. 109-479, asserts sovereign rights and exclusive fishery management authority over all fish on the Continental Shelf for the United States, except for highly migratory species of fish.
The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), codified in 16 U.S.C. § 1361 et seq., prohibits the taking and importing of marine mammals and their products, except for limited scientific research, incidental capture during commercial fishing, or activities deemed necessary by the Secretary of Commerce or Interior in accordance with sound conservation principles. The act also bans the importation of pregnant or nursing marine mammals, those from designated depleted species, or animals obtained inhumely. Additionally, it establishes a Marine Mammal Commission to study and recommend strategies for protecting marine mammals.  An exception to the MMPA allows the Secretary of Defense to authorize the taking of up to 25 non-endangered marine mammals annually for national defense purposes, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Commerce in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission. In 1988, P.L. 100-711 added provisions specifically aimed at reducing porpoise mortality during yellowfin tuna fishing in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.  In 1992, Congress amended the MMPA by adding two new laws: the International Dolphin Conservation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-523) to regulate certain tuna harvesting practices, and another act prohibiting specific practices deemed harmful to marine mammals.
The Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Act, enacted under Title III of Public Law 102-587, established the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program. Its primary purpose is to collect data on marine mammal health and coordinate effective responses to unusual mortality events through a process within the Department of Commerce.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-238) aimed to enhance programs to reduce incidental take of marine mammals during commercial fishing operations. This law mandated that the Secretary of Commerce issue permits for the importation of polar bear parts, excluding internal organs, taken in sport hunts in Canada. Additionally, it required a scientific review by the Secretary on the impact of these permits on Canadian polar bear populations within two years.  Further amendments included authorizing the Secretary to issue permits for marine mammals intended for public display only if the recipient is registered or licensed under the Animal Welfare Act. This change effectively delegated regulatory authority from the National Marine Fisheries Service to the Department of Agriculture once the animals were in captivity.  In 1997, the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act (P.L. 105-42) amended various sections of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. In 2007, Title IX of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-479) added the United States-Russia Polar Bear Conservation and Management Act of 2006 to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. This act further amended the original law with provisions related to pollution prevention from ships, as specified in 33 U.S.C.
The statutes from sections 1901 to 1915 direct the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, to study improper disposal practices and associated specific plastic articles that frequently occur in the environment and pose a threat to fish or wildlife. Additionally, this statute empowers the Secretary of Commerce to designate national marine sanctuaries.  The purpose of another statute is to assist in conserving marine turtles and their nesting habitats in foreign countries by supporting and providing financial resources for projects aimed at protecting these nesting grounds, conserving marine turtles within them, and addressing other threats to their survival.  A third statute authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to purchase or lease areas approved by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission if he deems them suitable as inviolate sanctuaries or for other management purposes related to migratory birds.  Established in 1998, this fund supports the African Elephant Conservation Act, the Asian Elephant Conservation Act, and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. Separate accounts within the fund include the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account and the Great Ape Conservation Fund.  A fourth statute aims to improve the health and productivity of essential domestic animals, including livestock, poultry, aquatic animals, and other income-producing animals crucial for the United States' food supply and the well-being of producers and consumers of animal products. As amended by P.L. 104-127 (1996), section 810 of this statute requires the Secretary of Agriculture to commission a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the delivery system used to provide farmers and ranchers with animal care, veterinary medical services, and animal drugs. The study should assess opportunities for advancing the well-being and treatment of farm animals.  Amended in 1996 by P.L. 104-127 (section 812), section 3193 of Title 7, U.S.C., mandates a further examination of the delivery system for animal care and veterinary medical services, including animal drugs.
