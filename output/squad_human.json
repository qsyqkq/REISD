The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.",

Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute. In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD in Gnotobiotics.",

Approximately 21–24% of these students were the children of alumni. While 37% came from the Midwestern United States, the student population represented all 50 states and over 100 countries.\n\nIn March 2007, The Princeton Review ranked Notre Dame as the fifth most preferred school for parents to send their children, though this ranking had dropped to ninth by March 2015. Although the university faced historical criticism for its lack of diversity, it received high praise from The Princeton Review for being a place where \"Alternative Lifestyles [are] Not an Alternative.\" Some outlets have commended Notre Dame's diversity initiatives: in 2004, Hispanic Magazine ranked it ninth among top colleges for Latinos, and The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education highlighted its increased African-American student enrollment in 2006.\n\nThe university is home to the largest intramural sports program with 6,000 participants. Sports Illustrated named Notre Dame the best such program in the nation in 2004, while The Princeton Review recognized it as leading for \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports\" in 2007. Annually, Notre Dame hosts the Bookstore Basketball tournament, considered the world's largest outdoor five-on-five basketball event with over 700 teams participating each year.

Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students, aware of the anti-Catholic animosity, blocked the Klansmen from descending from their trains in the South Bend station and ripped the KKK clothes and regalia. On May 19 thousands of students massed downtown protesting the Klavern, and only the arrival of college president Fr. Matthew Walsh prevented any further clashes. The next day, football coach Knute Rockne spoke at a campus rally and implored the students to obey the college president and refrain from further violence. A few days later the Klavern broke up, but the hostility shown by the students was an omen and a contribution to the downfall of the KKK in Indiana.",

Any album release, song, or performance by Beyoncé is considered a significant event and carries wide influence. Presently, she stands as the presumptive leading diva of the USA—the nation's dominant voice.\" In 2014, Beyoncé was again included on the Time 100 list and featured on its cover.",

The first schools were subscription schools that typically held in the teacher's home. The first formal school on record was at Fort Owen in Bitterroot valley in 1862. The students were Indian children and the children of Fort Owen employees. The first school term started in early winter and only lasted until February 28. Classes were taught by Mr. Robinson. Another early subscription school was started by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863. In this school students were charged $1.75 per week. The Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly had its inaugural meeting in 1864. The first legislature authorized counties to levy taxes for schools, which set the foundations for public schooling. Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and it formed fhe first public school in Virginia City in 1886. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather postponed its opening until March. The first school year ran through the summer and didn't end until August 17. One of the first teachers at the school was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who had traveled to Virginia City via wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took a test in her home and paid a $6 fee in gold dust to obtain a teaching certificate.",

Initially, these schools were subscription-based and often conducted in teachers' residences. The earliest documented formal school was established at Fort Owen in the Bitterroot Valley in 1862, educating Indian children alongside those of Fort Owen staff. Instructed by Mr. Robinson, classes commenced in early winter, concluding on February 28. Another precursor to public education was a subscription school founded by Thomas Dimsdale in Virginia City in 1863, where tuition was set at $1.75 weekly.\n\nThe inaugural session of the Montana Territorial Legislative Assembly took place in 1864, during which the first legislature empowered counties to impose taxes for educational purposes—laying groundwork for public schooling. Madison County promptly utilized these newly authorized funds to establish Virginia City's first public school in 1886. The initial school year was slated to begin in January 1866; however, harsh weather delayed its start until March, with the term extending into summer and concluding on August 17.\n\nAmong the early educators at this institution was Sarah Raymond, a young woman of 25 who journeyed to Virginia City by wagon train in 1865. To qualify as a certified teacher, she passed an examination from her home and paid $6 in gold dust for a teaching certificate.",

Moist air from the Pacific is blocked by mountain ranges, causing moisture retention in western valleys and creating rain shadows to the east. Heron, situated on the west side, receives the most rainfall at 34.70 inches (881 mm). Conversely, eastern valleys behind these mountains experience less precipitation; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches (291 mm), while Deer Lodge records 11.00 inches (279 mm) annually. Some mountainous regions receive over 100 inches (2,500 mm) of rain, such as the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park with 105 inches (2,700 mm). An area southwest of Belfry recorded an average precipitation of only 6.59 inches (167 mm) over sixteen years. Larger cities typically see snowfall ranging from 30 to 50 inches (0.76 to 1.27 meters) each year. Mountain ranges can accumulate up to 300 inches (7.62 meters) of snow in a single winter.

Subsequently, more than a dozen additional military outposts sprang up throughout the state. The discovery of gold in Montana and adjacent areas intensified disputes over land ownership. Noteworthy conflicts unfolded during Red Cloud's War, the Great Sioux War of 1876, as well as engagements involving the Nez Perce and Piegan Blackfeet tribes. Prominent skirmishes included the Marias Massacre (1870), Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876), Battle of the Big Hole (1877), and Battle of Bear Paw (1877). The final documented clash between the U.S. Army and Native Americans in Montana happened at the 1887 Battle of Crow Agency, located in the Big Horn country. Indigenous individuals who had signed treaties were generally moved to reservations thereafter.",

Other nations feared that including political groups in the definition would invite international intervention in domestic politics. However leading genocide scholar William Schabas states: “Rigorous examination of the travaux fails to confirm a popular impression in the literature that the opposition to inclusion of political genocide was some Soviet machination. The Soviet views were also shared by a number of other States for whom it is difficult to establish any geographic or social common denominator: Lebanon, Sweden, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic, Iran, Egypt, Belgium, and Uruguay. The exclusion of political groups was in fact originally promoted by a non-governmental organization, the World Jewish Congress, and it corresponded to Raphael Lemkin’s vision of the nature of the crime of genocide.”",

                "text": "Antibacterial antibiotics are generally classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. They primarily focus on disrupting bacterial functions or growth processes. Antibiotics that target the bacterial cell wall (such as penicillins and cephalosporins) or cell membrane (like polymyxins), or those that inhibit essential bacterial enzymes (including rifamycins, lipiarmycins, quinolones, and sulfonamides), are typically bactericidal. Conversely, antibiotics that disrupt protein synthesis (such as macrolides, lincosamides, and tetracyclines) are often bacteriostatic, although certain aminoglycosides can also be bactericidal.\n\nClassification further depends on target specificity; \"narrow-spectrum\" antibiotics specifically affect particular bacteria types like Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, while broad-spectrum antibiotics combat a wide array of bacteria. After four decades without the discovery of new antibacterial compound classes, four novel categories emerged in clinical use from the late 2000s to early 2010s: cyclic lipopeptides (e.g., daptomycin), glycylcyclines (e.g., tigecycline), oxazolidinones (e.g., linezolid), and lipiarmycins (e.g., fidaxomicin).",

Moreover, research have shown that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis, compared to controlled mice. In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting insulin levels in mice. However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans.

More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms.

Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist, in 1942. Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan now called arsphenamine.",

The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell's death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect \"good\" bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",

His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his compositional style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S.

The critic François-Joseph Fétis wrote in the Revue et gazette musicale: \"Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ...\" After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.

Additionally, Chopin was sought after for piano lessons, charging a premium rate of one guinea (£1.05 today) per hour, and received 20 guineas for private recitals. At a concert on July 7th, he performed with Viardot, who sang his mazurkas set to Spanish texts.",

Wang and Nyima assert that this \"tribute-related trade\" of the Ming exchanging Chinese tea for Tibetan horses—while granting Tibetan envoys and Tibetan merchants explicit permission to trade with Han Chinese merchants—\"furthered the rule of the Ming dynasty court over Tibet\". Rossabi and Sperling note that this trade in Tibetan horses for Chinese tea existed long before the Ming. Peter C. Perdue says that Wang Anshi (1021–1086), realizing that China could not produce enough militarily capable steeds, had also aimed to obtain horses from Inner Asia in exchange for Chinese tea. The Chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army's supply wagons. The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement. The Ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state-supervised markets, but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea-producing regions.",

Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \"big and clunky or small and useless\" with user interfaces that were \"unbelievably awful,\" so Apple decided to develop its own.

Inspired by \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" specifically the line \"Open the pod bay door, Hal!\", Chieco compared this to pairing a personal computer with an independent music player, similar to the Discovery One's white EVA Pods in the film. Upon further investigation, Apple found that Joseph N. Grasso of New Jersey had already filed for the trademark at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in July 2000, intended for Internet kiosks. Although public demonstrations of iPod-like kiosks occurred in New Jersey as early as March 1998 with commercial deployment starting in January 2000, these were reportedly discontinued by 2001. The USPTO granted the trademark to Grasso in November 2003, and he later transferred it to Apple Computer, Inc. in 2005.",

Midna is distinct in her voice acting; her dialogue is accompanied by pseudo-speech generated from rearranged English phonemes sampled from Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto's recordings.",

It was the second James Bond film to be shown in IMAX venues after *Skyfall*, even though it wasn't filmed using IMAX cameras. Upon its release, *Spectre* received mixed reviews; critics commented on its length and lack of screen time for new characters and writing, while praising its action sequences and cinematography. The theme song, \"Writing's on the Wall,\" elicited varied opinions compared to its predecessor, but it won a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. By February 20, 2016, *Spectre* had grossed over $879 million worldwide.",

Oberhauser shares his name with Hannes Oberhauser, a background character in the short story \"Octopussy\" from the Octopussy and The Living Daylights collection, and who is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young Bond in 1983. Similarly, Charmian Bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian, observing the back story established by Fleming. With the acquisition of the rights to Spectre and its associated characters, screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films, with the Quantum organisation alluded to in Casino Royale and introduced in Quantum of Solace reimagined as a division within Spectre rather than an independent organisation.",

The USGS similarly categorizes this intensity as XI under the Modified Mercalli scale (MM), indicating it is \"very disastrous.\" Two northwest-southeast bands with a liehua of XI are situated near Yingxiu and Wenchuan, close to the main earthquake's epicenter, and Beichuan, which experienced intense aftershocks including one measuring MS 6.1 on August 1, 2008; both towns are located in Sichuan Province, covering an area of 2,419 square kilometers. The Yingxiu XI zone extends approximately 66 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide along the Wenchuan–Dujiangyan–Pengzhou route, while the Beichuan XI zone spans about 82 kilometers long and 15 kilometers wide from An County to Pingwu. Regions with liehua X—translated as \"destructive\" on EMS and \"disastrous\" on MM—encompass an area of 3,144 square kilometers. Areas affected by earthquakes exceeding a liehua of VI span 440,442 square kilometers, forming an oval approximately 936 kilometers long by 596 kilometers wide, extending across three provinces and one autonomous region.",

On May 25, an aftershock measuring 6.0 Mw (or 6.4 Ms as per CEA) struck northeast of the original epicenter near Qingchuan County in Sichuan, resulting in eight deaths, 1,000 injuries, and widespread structural damage. Two more aftershocks occurred on May 27: a 5.2 Mw tremor in Qingchuan County and a 5.7 Mw quake in Ningqiang County, Shaanxi. These events led to the collapse of over 420,000 homes and injuries to 63 people. On July 23, additional aftershocks measuring 5.6 and 6.0 Ms (equivalent to 5.8 and 5.5 Mw according to USGS) struck the area, causing one death, six severe injuries, numerous home collapses, and significant highway damage.\n\nOn August 1, a 6.1 Ms aftershock (measured at 5.7 Mw by USGS) affected Pingwu County and Beichuan County in Sichuan, northeast of Wenchuan near the epicenter of a historic 7.2 Ms earthquake from 1976. This resulted in two deaths, 345 injuries, the collapse of 707 homes, damage to over 1,000 structures, and blocked rural roads spanning 25 kilometers.

For three minutes, everyone stood silently as air defense, police and fire sirens, along with horns from vehicles, vessels, and trains blared. Traffic on Beijing's roads came to a standstill. Subsequently, people spontaneously erupted into chants of \"Zhongguo jiayou!\" (Let's go, China!) and \"Sichuan jiayou\" (Let's go, Sichuan!).",

Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the New York City Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants.

Lee used the term \"Gothic\" to describe the architecture of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley.

Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism.

Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\"",

The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero. Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb. However, in 1997, the Alabama State Bar erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville, marking his existence as the \"first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history\". In 2008, Lee herself received an honorary special membership to the Alabama State Bar for creating Atticus who \"has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor\".",

The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism. This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks), and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of \"fine folks\" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.",

In its use of racial epithets, stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks, and Calpurnia, who to some critics is an updated version of the \"contented slave\" motif and to others simply unexplored, the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters. One writer asserts that the use of Scout's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout's voice \"functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us—black and white, male and female—to find our relative position in society\". A teaching guide for the novel published by The English Journal cautions, \"what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another\". A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students, but that black students found it \"demoralizing\". Another criticism, articulated by Michael Lind, is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural \"white trash\".",

In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether.

The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the \"right to dry\" clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 °C (40 °F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45–60 °C (113–140 °F). The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12 years) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems.",
