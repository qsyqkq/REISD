It's higher risk to the bank, since the principal outstanding is higher for longer.  According to the New York Times, \"Interest rates are usually an eighth- to a half-percentage point higher than on fully amortized jumbo loans.\" They're also tougher to qualify for, and fewer lenders offer them, again due to the risk to the bank. Since you can always put extra towards the principal, strictly speaking, these are the only  downsides. The upside, of course, is that you can make a lower payment each month. The question is what are you doing with this? If this is the only way you can afford the payments, there's a good chance the house is too expensive for you. You're not building equity in the home, and you have the risk of being underwater if the house price goes down. If you're using the money for other things, or you have variable income, it might be a different story. For the former, reinvesting in a business you own might be a reason, if you're cognizant of the risks. For the latter, salespeople on commission, or financial industry types who get most of their income in bonuses, can benefit from the flexibility.",

You are allowed to contribute up to $18,000 on the employee side across both 401(k) plans as you see fit. Additionally, you may make profit-sharing contributions of up to 20% of compensation in your solo 401(k) plan. However, this profit-sharing limit is cumulative across all plans related to your consulting business. If you maximize your contribution in the solo 401(k), it precludes additional contributions to a SEP IRA because the solo 401(k) takes precedence over the SEP IRA regarding contributions and shares a unified limit on profit-sharing contributions. Therefore, if you have a solo 401(k), there is no reason to maintain a SEP for the same business.\n\nExample reference: Is it possible to contribute to both a solo 401(k) and a SEP for the same company?",

After expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover. Option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays. An option has two values associated with it; time value and exercise value. Far out of the money (when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side) options only have time value whereas deep in the money options (as yours seems to be) has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy (sell) at a low (high) price and then sell (buy) the underlying.  The time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move (further) in your favour and make you more money at expiry. As expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no revaluing. Up to now what I have said applies to both OTC and traded options but exchange traded options have another level of complexity in their trading; because there are fewer traders in the options market the size of trade at which you can move the market is much lower. On the equities markets you may need to trade millions of shares to have be substantial enough to significantly move a price, on the options markets it could be thousands or even hundreds. If these are European style options (which sounds likely) and a single trading entity was holding a large number of the exchange traded options and now thinks that the price will move significantly against them before expiry their sell trade will move the market lower in spite of the options being in the money. Their trade is based on their supposition that by the time they can exercise the option the price will be below the strike and they will lose money. They have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying. If I am not correct in my excise style assumption (European) I may need more details on the trade as it seems like you should just exercise now and take the profit if it is that far into the money.",

Thus, you’re not compelled to execute; instead, you can allow the option to lapse if it doesn't automatically expire. Post-expiration, an out-of-the-money option becomes worthless and leaves no residual impact otherwise. Typically, option prices decrease as their time value diminishes over time. An option comprises two components: time value and intrinsic value. When far out of the money (meaning the underlying asset's price is significantly distant from the strike price on the unfavorable side), options retain only time value. Conversely, deep in-the-money options possess both time value and intrinsic value, representing the advantage of purchasing (or selling) at a favorable rate compared to the current market. The time value stems from the potential for further advantageous movement of the underlying asset's price by expiry, enhancing profitability. As expiration nears, this likelihood diminishes, often leading to sharp price adjustments after periods of stagnant valuation.\n\nThis explanation applies broadly to both over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded options; however, trading on exchanges introduces additional complexity due to fewer market participants in the options space. Consequently, smaller trades can significantly influence market prices compared to equity markets where millions might be necessary for impact. For instance, if these are European-style options—which seems probable—a significant holder of these traded options might sell them off in anticipation of unfavorable price movements before expiration. This action could depress the market despite the options being in-the-money, based on their prediction that by exercising, they'd incur losses due to expected unfavorable shifts. By selling early, they mitigate potential losses according to their assessment of future underlying asset performance.\n\nIf I've misjudged regarding them being European-style options, additional trade specifics might be required because if deeply in-the-money, it would typically be prudent to exercise immediately and realize the profit.",

Therefore, you aren't forced to act; instead, you can let the option expire if it doesn’t automatically do so. Once expired, an out-of-the-money option loses its value and has no further effect. Generally, as time progresses, the price of options falls due to a reduction in their time value. An option consists of two parts: intrinsic value and time value. When significantly away from being at the money (the underlying asset's price is far from the strike price unfavorably), options only possess time value. On the other hand, deep in-the-money options have both intrinsic and time values, indicating a benefit to buying or selling at a favorable rate compared to the market. The time value arises from the possibility of advantageous movements in the underlying asset’s price before expiration, enhancing profitability potential. As the expiration date approaches, this probability decreases, often resulting in significant price changes after periods of stable valuation.\n\nThis explanation is relevant for both over-the-counter (OTC) and exchange-traded options; however, trading on exchanges can be more intricate due to a smaller number of market participants in the options space. Hence, smaller trades can more easily affect prices compared to equity markets where larger volumes are required to make an impact. For example, if these are European-style options—which seems likely—a major holder may choose to sell them off before expiration in anticipation of adverse price movements.

The issue here is that while the numbers all work out the same between a lease and a purchase your situation is different.  If the leased car is totaled, the bank gets its money back from an insurer.  If that payment doesn't cover the value of the car, the GAP insurance will cover it.  In either situation, if there's an excess remaining it will be returned to you.  The issue is the excess may not fully replace your down payment.  If you then went to lease another car you would need to come up with that down payment again because you couldn't just simply choose to lease a used car; like you could in the case of a purchase.

Your PMI is 1.1%, not on the 'missing' $5000, but on the $85000 balance. So you are paying $935/yr extra due to the $5000 you didn't have available. In addition to the mortgage itself.

This fee depends on the total borrowed amount rather than just how much more is needed to reach 80% LTV. For simplicity, if you make a 15% down payment on a $100K house, your PMI of 1.1% applies not merely to the 'missing' $5,000 but to the remaining balance of $85,000. As a result, this leads to an additional cost of $935 per year due to the unavailable $5,000, besides the mortgage payment itself.

Academic research into ADRs seems to suggest that pairs-trading ADRs and their underlying shares reveals that there certainly are arbitrage opportunities, but that in most (but not all cases) such opportunities are quickly taken care of by the market. (See this article for the mexican case, the introduction has a list of other articles you could read on the subject). In some cases parity doesn't seem to be reached, which may have to do with transaction costs, the risk of transacting in a foreign market, as well as administrative & legal concerns that can affect the direct holder of a foreign share but don't impact the ADR holder (since those risks and costs are borne by the institution, which presumably has a better idea of how to manage such risks and costs). It's also worth pointing out that there are almost always arbitrage opportunities that get snapped up quickly: the law of one price doesn't apply for very short time-frames, just that if you're not an expert in that particular domain of the market, it might as well be a law since you won't see the arbitrage opportunities fast enough. That is to say, there are always opportunities for arbitrage with ADRs but chances are YOU won't be able to take advantage of it (In the Mexican case, the price divergence seems to have an average half-life of ~3 days). Some price divergence might be expected: ADR holders shouldn't be expected to know as much about the foreign market as the typical foreign share holder, and that uncertainty may also cause some divergence.

That is of course if the hospital even lets you pay them directly. Usually once something is sold to a collections company it's written off.

The collections companies want to make money on the debt they've bought so they will do what ever it takes to get it out of you, including dinging your credit report. The credit bureaus are the biggest nightmare to deal with of all. Once something is reported on your credit history they do little to nothing to remove it. You can report it online but this is a huge mistake because when you report online you wave your rights to sue the credit bureaus if they don't investigate the matter properly.

To avoid damaging your credit, consider dealing with the hospital directly. Pay off the bill, but first secure written confirmation that this payment will not impact your credit report. However, this might be challenging because hospitals often don't accept direct payments once a debt is handed over to collections. Typically, such debts are considered written off.\n\n**Long Answer:** Navigating credit reports can be overwhelming.

The credit bureaus themselves can be particularly troublesome; once an issue is reported in your credit history, they rarely remove it unless compelled.

I believe your statement is mostly correct:  ...all the expert recommendations are based on an inflexible conventional wisdom that presumes that all renters are relatively resource-poor. When you purchase a $50 electronic item at the store and are offered an extended warranty for $3, most people turn it down, not only because they don't think it's worth it, but also because in the event that the item fails between say years 1 and 3, they don't worry enough about that $50 to care if they have to buy a new one, or live without it. The percentage of your net worth also matters. For example, if you had an entire loss tomorrow, you'd be out $20K if you needed to re-purchase your possessions. (30K minus 10K in current coverage.) $20K is approximately 1/44 or 2.3% of your net worth. If a catastrophe occurs and you only lose 2.3% of your net worth, some might consider that lucky, so from that point of view it isn't really a big deal. But on the flip side, if the extra insurance only costs you $50 more per year, you may not even notice that dent in your net worth either. I think for most people, the value of items in their home may be their net worth, or at least a much larger percentage of it, in which case the insurance makes more sense.

                "text": "Interest on Amount Exceeding CC Balance? The best answer to this is: Read the fine print on your credit card agreement. What is common, at least in the US, is that you can make any charges you want during a time window.  When the date comes around that your statement balance is calculated, you will owe interest on any amount that is showing up as outstanding in your account.  Example...  To revise the example you gave, let's say Jan 1. your account balance was $0. Jan. 3rd you went out and spent $1,000.  Your account statement will be prepared every XX days... usually 30. So if your last statement was Dec. 27th, you can expect your next statement to be prepared ~Jan.24 or Jan. 27.  To be safe, (i.e. not accrue any interest charges) you will want to make sure that your balance shows $0 when your statement is next prepared.  So back to the example you gave--if your balance showed $1,000... and you paid it off, but then charged $2,000 to it... so that there was now a new set of $2,000 charges in your account, then the bank would begin charging you interest when your next statement was prepared.  Note that there are some cards that give you a certain number of days to pay off charges before accruing interest... it just goes back to my saying \"the best answer is read the fine print on your card agreement.\"",

For instance, if your account was $0 on January 1st and you spent $1,000 on January 3rd, interest would apply from when your next statement is issued. Statements are generally prepared every 30 days; hence, a statement due around December 27th might be released near January 24th or 27th.\n\nTo avoid interest charges, ensure your balance returns to $0 by the time your statement is generated. For example, if you had a $1,000 balance and paid it off but then charged an additional $2,000, the bank would start charging interest on the new $2,000 amount in your next statement.\n\nSome cards offer a grace period before interest accrues for purchases; however, always refer to your card agreement for specific details.",

Typically, especially within the U.S., you can make purchases over a set period without facing immediate repercussions.\n\nInterest starts accumulating on any remaining balance from the date listed on your statement. For example, if your account showed $0 on January 1st and you charged $1,000 on January 3rd, interest would begin accruing once your next statement is issued. Generally, statements are prepared every 30 days; therefore, a statement due around December 27th might be released close to January 24th or 27th.\n\nTo sidestep interest charges, ensure your balance is back to $0 by the time your statement is compiled. For instance, if you had a $1,000 balance that was paid off but then added another $2,000 in purchases, the bank would begin charging interest on the new $2,000 amount in the subsequent statement.\n\nWhile some cards provide a grace period before interest starts accumulating for purchases, always check your card agreement for precise details.",

My background: Institutional investment management, currency risk management. My thoughs are: Home Bias is the core concept of your quesiton. You will find many research papers on this topic. The main problems with a high home bias is that the investment universe in your small local investment market is usually geared toward your coutries large corporations. Lack of diversification: In your case: the ASX top 4 are all financials, actually banks, making up almost 25% of the index. I would expect the bond market to be similarly concentrated but I dont know. In a portfolio context, this is certainly a negative. Liquidity: A smaller economy obviously has less large corporations when compared globally (check wikipedia / List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization) thereby offering lower liquidity and a smaller investment universe. Currency Risk: I like your point on not taking a stance on FX. This simplifies the task to find a hedge ratio that minimises portfolio volatility when investing internationally and dealing with currencies. For equities, you would usually find that a hedge ratio anywhere from 0-30% is effective and for bonds one that ranges from 80-100%. The reason is that in an equity portfolio, currency risk contributes less to overall volatility than in a bond portfolio. Therefore you will need to hedge less to achieve the lowest possible risk. Interestingly, from a global perspective, we find, that the AUD is a special case whereby, if you hedge the AUD you actually increase total portfolio risk. Maybe it has to do with the AUD being used in carry trades a lot, but that is a wild guess. Hedged share classes: You could buy the currency hedged shared classes of investment funds to invest globally without taking currency risks. Be careful to read exactly what and how the share class implements its currency hedging though.",

Here's a rephrased version of your paragraph:\n\nHow should individuals living in smaller economies distribute their investments between local and international assets? This is a question we encounter frequently in Switzerland as well. My expertise lies in institutional investment management and managing currency risks. I believe the concept you're referring to is Home Bias, which has been extensively studied in research papers. One major issue with high home bias is that the range of available investments in smaller local markets typically focuses on large domestic corporations. This results in a lack of diversification. For instance, in your scenario, the top four companies on the ASX are all financial institutions—specifically banks—which constitute nearly 25% of the index. It's likely that the bond market is similarly concentrated, though I am unsure about this. In terms of portfolio management, this concentration is clearly a disadvantage.\n\nA smaller economy naturally has fewer large corporations compared to global standards (you can verify this on Wikipedia by checking the List of Public Corporations by Market Capitalization), which results in lower liquidity and a more limited investment universe.\n\nRegarding currency risk, I agree with your point about not taking a position on foreign exchange. This approach simplifies determining an optimal hedge ratio that minimizes portfolio volatility when investing internationally and dealing with different currencies. Generally, for equities, an effective hedge ratio ranges from 0-30%, while for bonds it typically falls between 80-100%. The reason is that currency risk contributes less to the overall volatility of an equity portfolio compared to a bond portfolio, so less hedging is needed to minimize risk.\n\nInterestingly, on a global scale, we observe that the Australian Dollar (AUD) presents a unique case. Hedging the AUD might actually increase total portfolio risk. This could be related to its frequent use in carry trades, though this is merely speculation. When considering hedged share classes of investment funds for global investments without currency risks, it's important to carefully review what and how these share classes implement their currency hedging strategies.",

If someone finds your card, they can use it for online purchases without knowing any PIN, just by entering the card number, expiration date, and security code on the back. Worse, sometimes that information is stored in databases, and those get stolen by hackers! Also, you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them, stopped using the service, and be surprised about the charge later. Debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your PIN to do online payments (the ones I have in the Netherlands do, anyway), and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones. Con: Banks get a percentage of each credit card payment. Unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction (of, say, half a cent), credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more, a significant part of the profit margin. I feel this is just wrong. Con: automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment With debit cards, the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money isn't there, you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way (credit card after all, other bank account, cash, etc). When a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently, someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money wasn't there. So I had to pay interest, on something I bought weeks ago... Pro: Credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance. I've never used this and don't know how it works, but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges. Pro: Credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases I don't know how it is with Visa or MC-issued debit cards, but many US sites accept only cards that have number/expiration date/security code and thus my normal bank account debit card isn't useable. Conclusion: definitely have one, but only use it when absolutely necessary.",

A stock's price is the market's valuation of the cash flows it entitles you to in the future.

A stock’s price mirrors the collective assessment by many investors who consider various relevant factors such as dividend rates, growth prospects, volatility, risk, industry, and more, which influence its value. In essence, a stock's price is the market's estimation of future cash flows tied to owning that stock. Analyzing a stock involves pinpointing potential errors or unknowns in these cash flow assessments by the market. However, any factors influencing a stock’s price are likely already known to the market, reducing the chance that this information will reveal whether a stock is undervalued.

The cost of a late payment charge is likely to far exceed any interest you would collect on your savings. Bear in mind that we are talking pennies here. I don't know how much the monthly bills that we are discussing here come to. Say it's $3,000. I think that would be a lot for most people. You say you're getting 3.6% on your savings. So if, on the average, you pay a bill 2 weeks later than you might have, you're getting an extra 2 / 52 x 3.6% x $3,000 in interest, or $4 per month. I think the last time I paid a late fee on a credit card it was $35, so if you make one mistake every 8 months and end up getting a late fee it will outweigh any savings.

I'm not aware of how much your monthly bills are, but let’s assume they total $3,000—a significant amount for many people. If you’re earning 3.6% on your savings and pay a bill two weeks later than usual, that would result in approximately $4 extra interest per month.

Regardless of how you pay, if there's any chance of missing the due date by waiting until then, it's best to avoid this strategy.

If you delay a bill payment by two weeks and earn 3.6% in savings interest, it would result in about $4 more per month. However, the last late fee I encountered on my credit card was $35.

Consider where you'll be after 10 years: In scenario #1 you've spent $5000 ($500*10) and have to continue spending $500/year indefinitely. In scenario #2 you've spent $40000 ($4000*10) and don't have to pay any more, but you currently have $35000 ($40000 - $5000) less than you did in scenario #1.

Here's a rephrased version of the paragraph:\n\nWhen planning how to allocate savings for a car purchase, it’s prudent to split your funds since you may need some in case of an emergency. Ensure at least half is easily accessible, like cash or accounts such as a Money Market Account (MMA) or checking account. For longer-term investments, consider Certificates of Deposit (CDs) ranging from 30 to 180 days, depending on your personal situation.\n\nKeep in mind that by the time you save enough for the car, your desire to buy it might decrease. How long will it take? It could be two years, five years, or even ten. You might want to evaluate whether a career change could help you earn more and save faster toward what you truly want.\n\nBeing prepared for life’s unforeseen hurdles is essential. For instance, my landlord sold the house I rented with a month-to-month lease. This required me to promptly find another rental and make an additional full deposit along with covering moving expenses. Luckily, I followed my tax attorney's guidance to keep a reserve of liquid assets that could cover at least three months’ worth of all expenditures.\n\nThe Mormon tradition suggests having a year’s supply of essentials like food, water, and supplies in your home for any eventuality. While not Mormon or religious myself, I’m open-minded about other perspectives. As always, remember that Your Mileage May Vary (YMMV).",

The key here is that you need to find a solution that works for you two without an overt amount of effort.  So in a sense it is somewhat behavior driven, but it is also technology driven.   My wife and I use spreadsheets for both checking account management and budgeting.  A key time saver is that we have a template sheet that gets copied and pasted, then modified for the current month.  Typically 90% of the stuff is the same and each month requires very little modification.  This is one of my problems with EveryDollar.  I have to enter everything each and every month. We also have separate checking accounts and responsibility for different areas of the family expenses.  Doing this risks that we act as roommates, but we both clearly understand the money in one persons account equally belongs to the other and during hard times had to make up for shortfalls on the part of the other. Also we use cash for groceries, eating out, and other day to day expenses.  So we don't have a great need to track expenses or enter transactions. That is what works for us, and it takes us very little time to manage our money.  The budget meeting normally lasts less than a half hour and that includes goal tracking. We kind of live by the 80/20 principle.  We don't see a value in tracking where every dime went.  We see more value in setting and meeting larger financial goals like contributing X amount to retirement and things of that nature.

This is analogous to having a portfolio of currencies that the central bank issues shares from - in the form of its own currency. We will continue with this analogy, if the central bank says these \"shares\" are worth $1, but the underlying components of the portfolio are worth $0.80 and decreasing, then it is expensive for the central bank to maintain its peg, and eventually they will have to disregard the peg as people start questioning the central bank's solvency. (People will know the $1 they hold is not really worth what the central bank says it is, because of the price changes people experience in buying goods and services, especially when it comes to imports. Shadow economies will also trade using a currency more reflective of labor, which happens no matter what the government's punishments are for doing so). Swiss National Bank (central bank) did this in early 2015, as it experienced volatility in the Euro which it had previously been trying to keep it's currency pegged to. It became too expensive for it to keep this peg on its own. The central bank can devalue its currency by adjusting the proportions of the reserve, such as selling a lot of foreign currency X, buying more of currency Y. They can and do take losses doing this. (Swiss National Bank is maintaining a large loss) They can also flood their economy with more of their currency, diluting the value of each individual 1 dollar equivalent. This is done by issuing bonds or monetizing goods and services from the private sector in exchange for bonds. People colloquially call this \"printing money\" but it is a misnomer in this day and age where printers are not relevant tools. The good and service goes onto the central bank's balance book, and the company/entity that provided the service now has a bond on its book which can be immediately sold to someone else for cash (another reading is that the bond is as good as cash). The bond didn't previously exist until the central bank said it did, and central banks can infinitely exchange goods and services for bonds.

The problems causes by a government having large debt are similar to those caused by an individual having large debt. The big issue is: More and more of your income goes to paying interest on the debt, and is thus not available for spending on goods and services. If it gets bad enough, you find you cannot make payments, you start defaulting on loans, and then you have to make serious sacrifices, like selling your property to pay the debt. Nations have an advantage over individuals in that they can sometimes repudiate debt, i.e. simply declare that they are not going to pay. Lenders can then refuse to give them more money, but that doesn't get their original loans paid back. In theory other nations could send in troops to seize property to pay the loan, but this is a very extreme solution. Totally aside from any moral considerations, modern warfare is very expensive, it's likely the war would cost you more than you'd recover on the debt. How much debt is too much? It's hard to give a number, any more than one could give a \"maximum acceptable debt\" for an individual. American banks have a rule of thumb that they won't normally loan you money if your total debt payments would be more than 1/3 of your income. I've never come close to that, that seems awfully high to me. But, say, a young person just starting out so he's not making a lot of money, and he lives someplace with high housing prices, might find this painful but acceptable. Etc.",

The severity depends on how one defines \"detrimental.\" Governments facing significant debt encounter issues similar to individuals with substantial personal debts. A critical concern is that an increasing portion of income must be allocated toward interest payments, reducing funds available for purchasing goods and services. If the situation worsens, a government may struggle to meet its obligations, default on loans, and be forced into severe measures like selling assets to settle debt. However, unlike individuals, nations can sometimes repudiate their debts by declaring non-payment. While lenders might withhold further loans, this does not address existing debt. In theory, other countries could intervene militarily to seize property for repayment, but such actions are extreme and impractical due to the high costs of modern warfare, which likely exceed potential debt recoveries.\n\nDetermining an excessive level of national debt is challenging, much like establishing a \"maximum acceptable\" personal debt threshold.

                "text": "How can one relatively easily show that low expense ratio funds outperform high expense ratio funds? I hope a wall of text with citations qualifies as \"relatively easy.\" Many of these studies are worth quoting at length. Long story short, a great deal of research has found that actively-managed funds underperform market indexes and passively-managed funds because of their high turnover and higher fees, among other factors.  Longer answer: Chris is right in stating that survivorship bias presents a problem for such research; however, there are several academic papers that address the survivorship problem, as well as the wider subject of active vs. passive performance. I'll try to provide a brief summary of some of the relevant literature.  The seminal paper that started the debate is Michael Jensen's 1968 paper titled \"The Performance of Mutual Funds in the Period 1945-1964\". This is the paper where Jensen's alpha, the ubiquitous measure of the performance of mutual fund managers, was first defined. Using a dataset of 115 mutual fund managers, Jensen finds that The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. Although this paper doesn't address problems of survivorship, it's notable because, among other points, it found that managers who actively picked stocks performed worse even when fund expenses were ignored. Since actively-managed funds tend to have higher expenses than passive funds, the actual picture looks even worse for actively managed funds. A more recent paper on the subject, which draws similar conclusions, is Martin Gruber's 1996 paper \"Another puzzle: The growth in actively managed mutual funds\". Gruber calls it \"a puzzle\" that investors still invest in actively-managed funds, given that their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds. He addresses survivorship bias by tracking funds across the entire sample, including through mergers. Since most mutual funds that disappear are merged into existing funds, he assumes that investors in a fund that disappear choose to continue investing their money in the fund that resulted from the merger. Using this assumption and standard measures of mutual fund performance, Gruber finds that mutual funds underperform an appropriately weighted average of the indices by about 65 basis points per year. Expense ratios for my sample averaged 113 basis points a year. These numbers suggest that active management adds value, but that mutual funds charge the investor more than the value added. Another nice paper is Mark Carhart's 1997 paper \"On persistence in mutual fund performance\" uses a sample free of survivorship bias because it includes \"all known equity funds over this period.\" It's worth quoting parts of this paper in full: I demonstrate that expenses have at least a one-for-one negative impact on fund performance, and that turnover also negatively impacts performance. ... Trading reduces performance by approximately 0.95% of the trade's market value.  In reference to expense ratios and other fees, Carhart finds that The investment costs of expense ratios, transaction costs, and load fees all have a direct, negative impact on performance. The study also finds that funds with abnormally high returns last year usually have higher-than-expected returns next year, but not in the following years, because of momentum effects. Lest you think the news is all bad, Russ Wermer's 2000 study \"Mutual fund performance: An empirical decomposition into stock‐picking talent, style, transactions costs, and expenses\" provides an interesting result. He finds that many actively-managed mutual funds hold stocks that outperform the market, even though the net return of the funds themselves underperforms passive funds and the market itself.  On a net-return level, the funds underperform broad market indexes by one percent a year. Of the 2.3% difference between the returns on stock holdings and the net returns of the funds, 0.7% per year is due to the lower average returns of the nonstock holdings of the funds during the period (relative to stocks). The remaining 1.6% per year is split almost evenly between the expense ratios and the transaction costs of the funds. The final paper I'll cite is a 2008 paper by Fama and French (of the Fama-French model covered in business schools) titled, appropriately, \"Mutual Fund Performance\". The paper is pretty technical, and somewhat above my level at this time of night, but the authors state one of their conclusions bluntly quite early on: After costs (that is, in terms of net returns to investors) active investment is a negative sum game.  Emphasis mine. In short, expense ratios, transaction costs, and other fees quickly diminish the returns to active investment. They find that The [value-weight] portfolio of mutual funds that invest primarily in U.S. equities is close to the market portfolio, and estimated before fees and expenses, its alpha is close to zero. Since the [value-weight] portfolio of funds produces an α close to zero in gross returns, the alpha estimated on the net returns to investors is negative by about the amount of fees and expenses. This implies that the higher the fees, the farther alpha decreases below zero. Since actively-managed mutual funds tend to have higher expense ratios than passively-managed index funds, it's safe to say that their net return to the investor is worse than a market index itself. I don't know of any free datasets that would allow you to research this, but one highly-regarded commercial dataset is the CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago. In financial research, CRSP is one of the \"gold standards\" for historical market data, so if you can access that data (perhaps for a firm or academic institution, if you're affiliated with one that has access), it's one way you could run some numbers yourself.",

One advantage of that region is that it's often affordable to vacation. All you need for a great time are fishing gear, a packed lunch, and some gas. I used to ski at Stevens Pass during weekdays, paying only a third of the weekend rate for lift tickets. Investing in hiking or camping equipment, or even a bicycle, can enhance your enjoyment of life too. Essentially, creating a budget is advisable, then proceed from there. If you're planning on retiring in Puerto Rico, your financial needs will be considerably lower than if you stay in Seattle—making this another subjective matter. For example, homes in Marysville, though far enough to make commuting challenging, are safe and pleasant. A $200K price tag for a 1,200 sq ft house is astonishing. In contrast, here in Orlando, similar-sized houses cost about $130K with shorter commutes, and you'll see the sun more than five days per year.",

To summarize your starting situation: You want to: Possible paths: No small business Get a job. Invest the 300K in safe liquid investments then move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts. Depending on which company you work for that could include 401K (Regular or Roth), deductible IRA, Roth IRA. The amount of money you can transfer is a function of the options they give you, how much they match, and the amount of income you earn. For the 401K you will invest from your paycheck, but pull an equal amount from the remainder of the 300K. If you are married you can use the same procedure for your spouse's account. You current income funds any vacations or splurges, because you will not need to put additional funds into your retirement plan. By your late 30's the 300K will now be fully invested in retirement account. Unfortunately you can't touch much of it without paying penalties until you are closer to age 60. Each year before semi-retirement, you will have to invest some of your salary into non-retirement accounts to cushion you between age 40 and age 60. Invest/start a business: Take a chunk of the  300K, and decide that in X years you will use it to start a small business. This chunk of money must be liquid and invested safely so that you can use it when you want to. You also don't want to invest it in investments that have a risk of loss. Take the remaining funds and invest it as described in the no small business section. You will completely convert funds to retirement funds earlier because of a smaller starting amount. Hopefully the small business creates enough income to allow you to continue to fund retirement or semi-retirement. But it might not. Comment regarding 5 year \"rules\": Roth IRA: you have to remain invested in the Roth IRA for 5 years otherwise your withdrawal is penalized. Investing in stocks: If your time horizon is short, then stocks are too volatile. If it drops just before you need the money, it might not recover in time. Final Advice: Get a financial adviser that will lay out a complete plan for a fixed fee. They will discuss investment options, types not particular funds. They will also explain the tax implications of investing in various retirement accounts, and how that will impact your semi-retirement plans. Review the plan every few years as tax laws change.",

The only taxes you should pay are on the interest generated by those money while sitting in the UK bank account. Since I suppose you already paid taxes on those money in Greece while you were earning those money. About being audited, in my own experience banks don't ask you much where your money are coming from when you bring money to them, they are very willing to help, and happy. (It's a differnte story when you ask to borrow money). When I opened a bank account in US I did not even have an SSN, but they didn't care much they just took my passport and used the passport number for registering the account. Obviously on the interest generated by the money in the US bank account I had to pay taxes, but it was easy because I simply let the IRS via the bank to withdarw the 27% on the interest generated (not on the capital deposited). I didn't put a huge amount of money there I had to live there for 1 year or some more. Maybe if i deposited a huge amount of money someone would have come to ask me how did I make all those money, but those money were legally generated by me working in Italy before so I didn't have anything to be afraid about. BTW: in Italy I was thinking to move money to a German bank in Germany. The risk of default is a nightmare, something of completly new now in UE compared to the past where each state had its own currency. According to Muro history says that in case of default it happened that some government prevented people from withdrawing money form bank accounts: \"Yes, historically governments have   shut down banks to prevent people from   withdrawing their money in times of   crisis. See Argentina circa 2001 or US   during Great Depression. The   government prevented people from   withdrawing their money and people   could do nothing while their money   rapidly lost value.\" but in case Greece prevents people from withdrwaing money, those money are still in EURO, so i'm wondering what would be the effect. I mean would it be fair that a Greek guy can not withdraw is EURO money whilest an Italian guy can withdraw the same currency money in Italy?!",

HFT is a proxy for human trading.  Although the computer is executing trades automatically based on an algorithm, it is still using money from a human being's account so the trading is still being done with someone's money. Fast execution of trades is desirable in exchanges.  Imagine two exchanges:  One only executes trades once a month, the other executes trades once a week.  Which exchange would be more desirable?  The exchange that trades once a week.  Why?  Because if I'm holding a stock that I would like to sell, I want to sell it now - not a month from now.  Same reason for buying.  This concept works all the way down to seconds and fractions of seconds. The issue with HFT, however, is there are cases where the market goes against the HFT algorithm and the algorithm continues to execute trades driving prices up or down by large amounts in the matter of minutes or even seconds. The exchange frequently cancels these trades which only encourages more aggressive HFT trading since HFT traders can have their losses cancelled.  This is a privilege that LFTs (low frequency traders) do not receive.  This is a valid criticism of HFTs.

Of course, if you withdraw 200k from your bank account, or deposit 200k into it then the government would know and it would certainly be flagged as suspicious.",

The book value represents the amount obtained if all company assets were sold off and the business liquidated. It's essentially what the company's value appears on its balance sheet. The price, however, is determined by what investors are willing to pay for a share. When the P/B ratio falls below one, it indicates that a company with a book value of $100 per share is trading at less than $99. This suggests the stock is being traded at a discount compared to its theoretical book value.\n\nConsider a scenario where a company owns a production plant located on high-value real estate. The company's market valuation primarily reflects its operational performance, such as output and order volume, rather than the actual value of the land it occupies. While the real estate's worth remains recorded in the books, investors might not fully factor this into their valuation.\n\nFor example, a construction firm could possess significant real estate holdings but struggle with insufficient cash flow to cover ongoing expenses. To stay afloat, the company may need to sell its real estate at discounted rates. Market investors, perceiving potential risks, might drive the stock price well below its book value.

If you're willing to accept a little more risk, you can invest in some index tracking ETFs instead, with the main providers in Australia being Vanguard, Street State and Betashares.  A useful tool for for an overview of the Australian ETF market is offered by StockSpot. The index funds reduce your level of risk by investing in an index of the market, e.g. the S&P 200 tracked by STW.  If the market as a whole rises, then your investment will too, even though within that index individual companies will rise and fall. This limits your potential rate of return as well, and is still significantly more risky than leaving your cash in an Aussie bank (after all, the whole market can fall), but it might strike the right balance for you. If you're getting started, HSBC, Nabtrade, Commsec and Westpac were all offering a couple of months of free trades up to a certain value.

So if it's 20 miles from your house to your employer (location A), and 30 miles from your house to the business you're contracting at (location B), you can only claim 10 miles each way (so 20 miles total). Obviously if the distance to location B is closer than your employer (location A), you're out of luck.

In life, you have a series of projects that you can undertake which may yield a positive net present value (for simplicity, let's define positive net present value as a project that yields more benefit than its cost). Let's say that one of the projects that you have is to build a factory to make clothing.  The factory will cost 1 million dollars and will generate revenue of 1.5 million dollars over the next year, afterwhich it wears out. Although you have the knowledge to build this wonderful factory, you don't have a million bucks laying around, so instead, you go borrow it from the bank.  The bank charges you 10% interest on the loan, which means that at the end of the year, the project has yielded a return of 400k. This is an extremely simplified example of what you call \"good\" debt.  It is good if you are taking the debt and purchasing something with a positive value. In reality, this should be how people should approach all purchases, even if they are with cash.  Everything that you buy is an investment in yourself - even entertainment and luxury items all could be seen as an investment in your happiness and relaxation.

Generally, it's recommended to roll over the account into an IRA after leaving your job to avoid issues my knowledgeable colleagues have highlighted. Once in an IRA, you gain more flexibility due to the \"allowed but not required\" rules. With few exceptions, there is little reason to keep the account with the 401(k) once you've left that employer.

In this form, we value gold in the same way we value the dollar, it allows us to purchase things we want. As a medium of exchange, gold has no definitive value and is only assigned one during the process of an exchange. For example, I would be valuing one ingot of gold to be worth a dog if I traded a dog for one ingot of gold. The value of gold in this sense is subjective as each person decides for themselves what gold is worth during the transaction. Gold as an end is valued for its own sake. A good example of this is a jeweler who purchases gold directly because of the intrinsic property(s) gold possesses. This is closer to the \"true value\" of gold than using it as a means, but virtually no one in our society views gold in this manor because virtually no one can use gold in this manor. \"You know what I could use right now, a block of gold.\" - said no one ever.  But even if you are one of the select few who value gold for its own sake, this is usually done because gold provides a function. For example, if people no longer want to ware jewelry, then a jeweler will likely have to find a new line of work where he would likely no longer view gold as valuable as an ends. To sum up, gold has a perceived value for most people and an \"intrinsic value\" to a select few (for the time being).",

In this capacity, its worth is not inherent but is instead determined during the act of exchange. For instance, if I traded a dog for one ingot of gold, I would consider that particular ingot equivalent in value to the dog. This perspective on gold's value is subjective and varies based on individual transactions.\n\nAlternatively, when gold is seen as an end, it holds intrinsic worth due to its unique properties. Jewelers often purchase gold for these characteristics, reflecting a closer approximation of gold's \"true\" value than using it merely as currency. However, in modern society, few people perceive gold primarily in this way since direct usage remains limited. The sentiment, \"You know what I could use right now, a block of gold,\" captures the rarity with which people see gold purely for its own sake.\n\nEven among those who appreciate gold intrinsically, its value often relates to the utility it provides. For example, if jewelry demand were to decline significantly, jewelers might no longer find gold valuable as an end and would likely shift their focus elsewhere in their profession. In summary, while most people see gold's worth subjectively based on perceived use, a select few attribute intrinsic value to it, contingent upon its functional relevance at the time.",

In this role, its value is not intrinsic but instead is determined during the transaction process. For example, if I exchanged a dog for one ingot of gold, I would deem that specific ingot equivalent in value to the dog. This view of gold's worth is subjective and varies with each individual exchange.\n\nOn the other hand, when gold is regarded as an ultimate goal, it possesses inherent worth due to its distinctive attributes. Jewelers often buy gold for these features, representing a closer estimation of gold's \"true\" value than simply using it as money. Nonetheless, in today's society, few individuals see gold primarily through this lens since direct applications are limited. The remark, \"You know what I could use right now, a block of gold,\" underscores how seldom people regard gold purely for its own sake.\n\nEven among those who value gold intrinsically, its worth often ties to the utility it offers.

Yes, theoretically you can flip the shares you agreed to buy and make a profit, but you're banking on the market behaving in some very precise and potentially unlikely ways.  In practice it's very tricky for you to successfully navigate paying arbitrarily more for a stock than it's currently listed for, and selling it back again for enough to cover the difference.  Yes, the price could drop to $28, but it could just as easily drop to $27.73 (or further) and now you're hurting, before even taking into account the potentially hefty commissions involved. Another way to think about it is to recognize that an option transaction is a bet; the buyer is betting a small amount of money that a stock will move in the direction they expect, the seller is betting a large amount of money that the same stock will not.  One of you has to lose.  And unless you've some reason to be solidly confident in your predictive powers the loser, long term, is quite likely to be you. Now that said, it is possible (particularly when selling puts) to create win-win scenarios for yourself, where you're betting one direction, but you'd be perfectly happy with the alternative(s).   Here's an example.  Suppose, unrelated to the option chain, you've come to the conclusion that you'd be happy paying $28 for BBY.  It's currently (June 2011) at ~$31, so you can't buy it on the open market for a price you'd be happy with.  But you could sell a $28 put, promising to buy it at that price should someone want to sell it (presumably, because the price is now below $28). Either the put expires worthless and you pocket a few bucks and you're basically no worse off because the stock is still overpriced by your estimates, or the option is executed, and you receive 100 shares of BBY at a price you previously decided you were willing to pay.  Even if the list price is now lower, long term you expect the stock to be worth more than $28.  Conceptually, this makes selling a put very similar to being paid to place a limit order to buy the stock itself. Of course, you could be wrong in your estimate (too low, and you now have a position that might not become profitable; too high, and you never get in and instead just watch the stock gain in value), but that is not unique to options - if you're bad at estimating value (which is not to be confused with predicting price movement) you're doomed just about whatever you do.",

The stock's price might fall to $28, but there's also a chance it could drop to $27.73 or even lower, resulting in losses before considering significant commission fees.\n\nIt's important to view an option transaction as a wager: the buyer bets a small amount on the stock moving in their expected direction, while the seller stakes more on it not doing so. One party is bound to lose, and without strong confidence in your predictive abilities, you're likely to be that losing party over time.\n\nHowever, particularly when selling puts, there are scenarios where both outcomes can be favorable for you. For instance, if you believe $28 is a fair price for BBY (currently priced around $31 in June 2011), and want it at this price, selling a $28 put lets you agree to buy it at that value if the market dips below $28. If the option expires without being exercised, you earn some profit with no downside since the stock remains overvalued by your assessment.

One complication if you buy jointly, and decide to break up/move, on will the other partner be able to refinance?  If not the leaving person will probably not be able to finance a new home as the banks are rarely willing to assume multiple mortgage risks for one person.

The trouble with that is that it sounds like you are in better position to be the owner, and she has a higher emotional need to own.

If you buy jointly and later decide to split or move, can the remaining partner refinance on their own? The person leaving might struggle to secure financing for a new home since banks usually avoid assuming multiple mortgage risks for one individual, regardless of high income or large down payments. I favor the arrangement where one person rents over the first option. However, this choice could imply you're better suited to be the owner while she has a stronger emotional desire to own property.\n\nIf her primary goal is to build equity, I suggest opting for a 15-year mortgage or shorter.

Investing in the S&P500 on the behalf of the investor shouldn’t need a fee, but investing in a smart beta or an alpha strategy, that generates returns independent of the market’s movement and certainly commands a fee. But how does one figure if that fee is justified? It is really simple. What is the risk-adjusted performance of the strategy? What is the Sharpe ratio?

In general, small cap stocks are exposed to more downside during recessions and when credit is tight, because it is more difficult for small companies to raise capital, and minor variations in cash flow have a bigger impact. Coming out of recessions or when credit is cheap, small companies generally perform better than larger companies. In the depths of recession, small companies with good cash flow are often great value investments, as analysts and institutional investors \"punish\" the entire class of smallcap companies.",

Where do you want to live?  Are there suitable jobs nearby?  How much do they pay? Emergency fund.  Banks care that you have \"reserves\" (and/or an unsecured line of credit) in case you have a run of bad luck.  This also helps with float the large expenses when closing a loan. Personal line of credit. Who are you building for?  If you are not married, then you should consider whether building a home makes that easier, or harder.  If you hope to have kids, you should consider whether your home will make it easier to have kids, or harder.  If you are married (or seriously considering it), make sure that your spouse helps with the shopping, and is in agreement on the priorities and choices.  If you are not married, then what will you do if/when you get married?  Will you sell?  expand?  build another house on the same lot?  rent the home out? Total budget.  How much can the lot, utilities, permits, taxes, financing charges, building costs, and contingency allowance come to?  Talk with a banker about how much you can afford.  Talk with a build-on-your-lot builder about how much house you can get for that budget.  Consider a new mobile or manufactured home.  But if you do choose one, ask your banker how that affects what you can borrow, and how it affects your rates and terms.  Talk with a good real estate agent about how much the resale value might be. Finished lot budget. How much can you budget for the lot, utilities, permits required to get zoning approval, fees, interest, and taxes before you start construction? Down payment.  It sounds like you have a plan for this. Loan underwriting.  Talk with a good bank loan officer about what their expectations are.  Ask about the \"front-end\" and \"back-end\" Debt-To-Income ratios.  In Oregon, I recommend Washington Federal for lot loans and construction loans.  They keep all of their loans, and service the loans themselves.  They use appraisers who are specially trained in evaluating new home construction.  Their appraisers tend to appraise a bit low, but not ridiculously low like the incompetent appraisers used by some other banks in the area.  (I know two banks with lots of Oregon branches that use an appraiser who ignores 40% of the finished, heated area of some to-be-built homes.)  Avoid any institution (including USAA and NavyFed) that outsources their lending to PHH. Lot loan.  In Oregon, Washington Federal offers lot loans with 30% down payments, 20-year amortization, and one point, on approved credit.  The interest rate can be a fixed rate, but is typically a few percentage points per year higher than for a mortgage secured by a permanent house.  If you have the financial wherewithal to start building within two years, Washington Federal also offers short-term lot loans.  Ask about the costs of appraisals, points, and recording fees. Rent.  How much will it cost to rent a place to live, between when you move back to Oregon, and when your new home is ready to move into? Commute.  How much time will it take to get from your new home to work?  How much will it cost?  (E.g., car ownership, depreciation, maintenance, insurance, taxes, fuel?  If public transportation is an option, how much will it cost?) Lot availability.  How many are there to choose from?  Can you talk a farmer into selling off a chunk of land?  Can you homestead government land?  How much does a lot cost?  Is it worth getting a double lot (or an extra large lot)? Utilities. Do you want to live off the grid?  Are you willing to make the choices needed to do that?  (E.g., well, generator, septic system, satellite TV and telephony, fuel storage)  If not, how much will it cost to connect to such systems?  (For practical purposes, subtract twice the value of these installation costs from the cost of a finished lot, when comparing lot deals.) Easements. These provide access to your property, access for others through your property, and affect your rights.  Utility companies often ask for far more rights than they need.  Until you sign on the dotted line, you can negotiate them down to just what they need.  Talk to a good real estate attorney. Zoning. How much will you be allowed to build?  (In terms of home square footage, garage square footage, roof area, and impermeable surfaces.)  How can the home be used?  (As a business, as a farm, how many unrelated people can live there, etc.)  What setbacks are required?  How tall can the building(s) be?  Are there setbacks from streams, swamps, ponds, wetlands, or steep slopes? Choosing a builder.  For construction loans, banks want builders who will build what is agreed upon, in a timely fashion.  If you want to build your own house, talk to your loan officer about what the bank expects in a builder. Plansets and permits.  The construction loan process. If you hire a general contractor, and if you have difficulties with the contractor, you might be forced to refuse to accept some work as being complete.  A good bank will back you up.  Ask about points, appraisal charges, and inspection fees. Insurance during construction.  Some companies have good plans -- if the construction takes 12 months or less.  Some (but not all) auto insurance companies also offer good homeowners' insurance for homes under construction.  Choose your auto insurance company accordingly. Property taxes. Don't forget to include them in your post-construction budget. Homeowners' insurance.  Avoid properties that need flood insurance.  Apply a sanity check to flood maps -- some of them are unrealistic.  Strongly consider earthquake insurance.  Don't forget to include these costs in your post-construction budget. Energy costs.  Some jurisdictions require you to calculate how large a heating system you need.  Do not trust their design temperatures -- they may not allow for enough heating during a cold snap, especially if you have a heat pump.  (Some heat pumps work at -10°F -- but most lose their effectiveness between 10°F and 25°F.)  You can use these calculations, in combination with the number of \"heating degree days\" and \"cooling degree days\" at your site, to accurately estimate your energy bills.  If you choose a mobile or manufactured home, calculate how much extra its energy bills will be. Home design.  Here are some good sources of ideas: A Pattern Language, by Christopher Alexander.  Alexander emphasizes building homes and neighborhoods that can grow, and that have niches within niches within niches. The Not-So-Big House, by Sarah Susanka.  This book applies many Alexander's design patterns to medium and large new houses. Before the Architect.  The late Ralph Pressel emphasized the importance of plywood sheathing, flashing, pocket doors, wide hallways, wide stairways, attic trusses, and open-truss or I-joist floor systems.  Lots of outlets and incandescent lighting are good too.  (It is possible to have too much detail in a house plan, and too much room in a house.  For examples, see any of his plans.) Tim Garrison, \"the builder's engineer\".  Since Oregon is in earthquake country -- and the building codes do not fully reflect that risk -- emphasize that you want a building that would meet San Jose, California's earthquake code.",

Consider these essential factors, which Alan and Denise Fields explore further in their book *Your New House*. \n\n**Permanent Employment**: Reflect on your preferred living location. Are there suitable job opportunities nearby? What are the typical salaries?\n\n**Emergency Fund**: Banks appreciate having \"reserves\" (or an unsecured line of credit) to cover unexpected expenses or difficulties, which can also assist with managing substantial costs when securing a loan.\n\n**Personal Line of Credit**: Consider your future plans. If you're not married, think about how purchasing a home could affect this aspect of your life—whether it simplifies or complicates things. For those planning children, assess if the home supports this decision. Married couples should ensure both partners participate in decisions regarding priorities and preferences. Unmarried individuals might wonder what their next steps will be upon marriage.\n\n**Total Budget**: Determine how much you can allocate for land costs, utilities, permits, taxes, financing fees, construction expenses, and a contingency fund. Consult with a banker about your financial capacity and discuss potential home sizes with a builder on your lot within this budget. Consider alternatives like mobile or manufactured homes, and inquire about their impact on borrowing capacity.\n\n**Finished Lot Budget**: Estimate the costs for utilities, permits, zoning approvals, fees, interest, and taxes before construction begins.\n\n**Down Payment**: Having a plan in place is advisable.\n\n**Loan Underwriting**: Discuss expectations with a seasoned bank loan officer. Ask about the \"front-end\" and \"back-end\" Debt-To-Income ratios. In Oregon, Washington Federal is recommended for lot loans and construction loans due to their retention of all loans and self-service approach. Their appraisers are trained in evaluating new home constructions.\n\n**Choosing a Builder**: For construction loans, banks prefer builders who complete projects as agreed and within the timeline. If building independently, verify the bank's builder requirements with your loan officer.\n\n**Construction Loan Process**: Engage a general contractor if necessary and be prepared for potential issues that might lead to disputes over completed work. Ensure your bank supports you in these situations.\n\n**Insurance During Construction**: Seek insurance plans suited for construction periods up to 12 months, as some auto insurers also offer coverage for homes under construction.\n\n**Property Taxes & Insurance**: Include property taxes and homeowners' insurance in your post-construction budget. Avoid properties requiring flood insurance; apply a practical approach to flood maps. Consider earthquake insurance due to the potential risks in earthquake-prone areas like Oregon.\n\n**Energy Costs**: Some regions require calculations for heating systems based on design temperatures, but verify these calculations as they might underestimate needs during colder spells. Use \"heating degree days\" and \"cooling degree days\" to estimate energy expenses accurately. For mobile or manufactured homes, account for increased energy costs.\n\n**Home Design**: Explore design inspirations from books like *A Pattern Language* by Christopher Alexander, which emphasizes adaptable homes, and *The Not-So-Big House* by Sarah Susanka that applies these principles to larger houses. Ralph Pressel’s insights in *Before the Architect*, including structural elements like plywood sheathing and attic trusses, can be beneficial, especially considering Oregon's earthquake risks.\n\nBy carefully considering each of these aspects, you'll be better equipped for purchasing land and planning your home effectively.",

Here is a rephrased version of the paragraph:\n\nConsider these key factors if you're thinking about buying land, as detailed further by Alan and Denise Fields in their book *Your New House*.\n\n**Stable Employment**: Think about where you want to live. Are there good job opportunities nearby? What are the average salaries?\n\n**Savings for Emergencies**: Banks favor having \"reserves\" (or an unsecured line of credit) to manage unexpected expenses or challenges, which can also help with large payments when obtaining a loan.\n\n**Personal Credit Line**: Reflect on your future. If you’re single, consider how buying a home might affect this stage of life—whether it simplifies or complicates matters. For those planning to have children, evaluate if the home supports this choice. Married couples should ensure both partners are involved in decisions about priorities and preferences. Unmarried individuals may ponder their next steps after marriage.\n\n**Overall Budget**: Figure out how much you can spend on land costs, utilities, permits, taxes, financing fees, construction expenses, and a contingency fund. Discuss your financial limits with a banker and talk to a builder about possible home sizes on your lot within this budget. Explore options like mobile or manufactured homes, and ask how they might affect your borrowing ability.\n\n**Ready Lot Budget**: Calculate the costs for utilities, permits, zoning approvals, fees, interest, and taxes before starting construction.\n\n**Down Payment**: It’s wise to have a plan ready.\n\n**Loan Approval Process**: Talk with an experienced bank loan officer about what to expect. Inquire about the \"front-end\" and \"back-end\" Debt-To-Income ratios. Oregonians may find Washington Federal beneficial for lot and construction loans, as they keep all their loans in-house and offer self-service options. Their appraisers are skilled in assessing new home constructions.\n\n**Selecting a Builder**: For construction loans, banks favor builders who complete projects on schedule and according to agreements. If building yourself, check the bank's builder requirements with your loan officer.\n\n**Construction Loan Procedure**: Consider hiring a general contractor if needed and be ready for potential issues that might lead to disagreements over completed work. Ensure your bank supports you in these situations.\n\n**Insurance During Construction**: Look into insurance plans suitable for construction periods up to 12 months, as some auto insurers also provide coverage for homes under construction.\n\n**Property Taxes & Insurance Post-Construction**: Factor property taxes and homeowners' insurance into your budget after the house is built. Avoid properties that need flood insurance; use a sensible approach when interpreting flood maps. Consider earthquake insurance due to potential risks in areas like Oregon.\n\n**Energy Costs**: Some regions require heating system calculations based on design temperatures, but double-check these as they might underestimate needs during colder weather. Use \"heating degree days\" and \"cooling degree days\" for accurate energy cost estimates. For mobile or manufactured homes, anticipate higher energy costs.\n\n**Home Design**: Explore design ideas from books like *A Pattern Language* by Christopher Alexander, which focuses on adaptable homes, and *The Not-So-Big House* by Sarah Susanka that applies these concepts to larger houses. Ralph Pressel’s insights in *Before the Architect*, including structural elements like plywood sheathing and attic trusses, are useful, especially considering Oregon's earthquake risks.\n\nBy thoroughly evaluating each of these aspects, you'll be better prepared for purchasing land and planning your home effectively.",

It does. In fact, in many countries LLC are considered separate entities for tax properties and you have double taxation - the LLC pays its own taxes, and then when you withdraw the money from the LLC to your own account (i.e.: take dividends) - you pay income tax on the withdrawal again. Corporate entities usually do not have preferential tax treatment for investments. In the US, LLC is a pass-though entity (unless explicitly chosen to be taxed as a corporation, and then the above scenario happens). Pass-through entities (LLCs and partnerships) don't pay taxes, but instead report the gains to the owners, which then pay taxes as if the transaction was their personal one. So if you're in the US - investing under LLC would have no effect whatsoever on your taxes, or adverse effect if you chose to treat it as a corporation. In any case, investing in stocks is not a deductible expense, and as such doesn't reduce profits.",

DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. You had already consulted doctors and they prescribed medicines to you and said there is nothing to worry. In that case, you should accept their opinion and stop worrying. You may consult an urologist if you again want to do so. But, I suggest, make it the last time. Worry, anxiety and obsession is another key basic reason for pains which may not have any medical explanation. The best method is to ignore the pain. You also mention that the pain is after masturbation. Stop masturbating for 15 days and restart. You will get relief.

Hello,Bronchitis or lung disease with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is generally not associated with asthma and your sister needs a full respiratory evaluation.Chest X Ray is not a sensitive test, so a HRCT (high resolution CT scan) will be required to see the lymph nodes in detail.There are several conditions especially infections that present with enlarged lymph nodes and present with shortness of breath (appears like asthma) and hence the requirement of a full check.Lung function tests (pulmonary function tests) with diffusion capacity is required as well. A bronschopy may be required after the HRCT scan.Blood tests: Complete hemogram, Liver function tests, ACE level, IgE, Urea Creatinine, ANA, ANCA are also required.A treatment plan can be decided only after these tests are done.I hope that was useful.Best Wishes.",

Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As you have told me, your husband is suffering from racing thoughts, this might be a part of his personality which is right from his childhood causing racing thoughts and also behaving based on those thoughts. One modality of getting better from this is to regularly exercise at least 2 to 3 days per week and have regular walks in the morning time so that the neurotransmitter levels in the brain get normal and the neurotransmitters responsible for pleasure also increases in his brain so that he feels better, then his racing thoughts will come down. If he still has a problem then short term mood stabilizers can be taken which will help him feel better regarding his racing thoughts. I hope I have solved your query.

One way to manage this is by engaging in regular exercise, ideally 2-3 times a week, and taking morning walks to help normalize neurotransmitter levels in the brain. This can also increase pleasure-related neurotransmitters, potentially reducing his racing thoughts. If these steps are not sufficient, short-term mood stabilizers may be considered as they could improve how he manages these thoughts. I hope this addresses your concerns. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions.\n\nThank you.",

From what you've described, it appears that your husband has always had racing thoughts, which might be a part of his personality since he was young.

To manage this, engaging in regular exercise, such as 3 times a week or taking morning walks, can help regulate neurotransmitter levels in the brain and increase pleasure-related neurotransmitters, which might reduce his racing thoughts.

Based on this is possible to remove brown colour to white and how much does it cost? Hi. I have seen the picture attached along with your complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have severe dental fluorosis along with severe external stains. It is definitely possible to get whiter teeth with the help of dental veneers. Firstly the procedure includes complete thorough cleaning of the stains. Secondly the teeth visible in your smile zone will have to be prepared (ground slightly on the front surfaces) to fix in the dental veneers. Coming to the cost of the procedure,there are two types of veneers. One is composite veneers which has to be done in the clinic manually by the dentist. But this has short life and a major disadvantage of discoloration. Two, ceramic dental veneers which have to be made in the laboratory and then fixed on the prepared teeth. Ceramic ones are much suitable for you as it can long last and hide the brownish colour of your present teeth to a greater extent but this is expensive than composite ones. Ceramic veneers have different price ranges and it depends on your dentist and the laboratory. Discuss with the your dentist about it and choose your best suited range.",

You have severe dental fluorosis along with significant external staining. Achieving whiter teeth through dental veneers is definitely feasible. The process begins with an extensive cleaning of the stains. Next, the teeth in your smile zone will need to be slightly reshaped on their front surfaces to fit the veneers properly. Regarding costs, there are two types of veneers: composite and ceramic. Composite veneers, created manually by the dentist during a clinic visit, have a shorter lifespan and may discolor over time. Ceramic veneers, fabricated in a lab and then affixed to your teeth, offer greater durability and better concealment of brownish tones, though they come at a higher price than composite ones.

After examining your provided picture (attachment removed for privacy), I observed you have severe dental fluorosis accompanied by considerable external staining. Whitening your teeth using dental veneers is certainly an option. The initial step involves thoroughly cleaning the stains. Subsequently, the front surfaces of your teeth within your smile area will need minor reshaping to ensure a proper fit for the veneers. In terms of costs, there are two varieties: composite and ceramic. Composite veneers, crafted by the dentist during a single clinic visit, tend to have a shorter lifespan and might yellow over time. Ceramic veneers, made in a lab before being attached to your teeth, offer enhanced durability and better masking of brownish hues but come with a higher price tag compared to composite ones. The cost for ceramic veneers varies based on the dentist and laboratory involved.

At 18 years age, you are too young to judge the size of  your penis. It is made up of muscles and the growth at puberty and adolescent is under the influence of testosterone. A research study was done in healthy Indian males on penis size during flaccid and erect and the width of the penis. Mean flaccid length was found to be 8.21 cm, mean stretched length 10.88 cm and circumference 9.14 cm. Mean erected length was found to be 13.01 cm and erected circumference was 11.46 cm. If your penis measurements are at least as mentioned above then there is no need to worry.Semen flowing with urine is a misconception in most men at your age. If you feel it is present then it needs to be evaluated after clinical examination with the urologist. Any urine infection must also be ruled out.",

While your yellow urine might be caused by dehydration, it's crucial to eliminate the possibility of an infection. Necessary investigations include a routine hemogram, random blood sugar test, urine RE/ME, urine culture and sensitivity, and an abdominal ultrasound. Treatment will depend on these results.

It seems like there is a small swelling near your cheeks rather than under them, which might feel unusual. You suspect it could be related to a nerve or perhaps a tumor, while your sister thinks it may be connected to your wisdom teeth, especially since it moves when you touch it.\n\nTo address your concern: A lump in that area often results from an enlarged lymph node, specifically within the sub-mandibular group, which can occur due to infections in the head and neck region, such as those affecting the teeth, gums, or ears. I recommend consulting a physician for a proper evaluation. If an infection is present, antibiotics may reduce the swelling.\n\nShould the lump persist despite treatment or if no underlying issue is identified, a biopsy might be necessary to exclude any possibility of malignant growths like tumors.\n\nI hope this information helps alleviate your concern and that you recover swiftly.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nDr. Harry Maheshwari\n\n---",

Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and the symptoms of irregular hormones (which can also delay your period) are very similar to the symptoms of pregnancy.  Women sometimes don't ovulate at the same time as usual, and other factors, such as weight changes, travel, and stress, can also make your cycle abnormal.Furthermore, in your particular case, your husband has been sterilized.  And you had a pregnancy test that was negative, which is just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office.So I think you do not have to worry about being pregnant.To be totally secure about your husband's sterility, he could get a sperm count done to make sure the vasectomy worked, if you would find that reassuring.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown",

Recently, over the past two weeks, I've experienced pregnancy-like symptoms: increased urination, tender and swollen breasts, nausea, and my period is now two days late. Despite taking a home pregnancy test last week, which was negative, I still have some concerns. Additionally, there's been slight white discharge. Could I be pregnant?\n\nHello! Let me assist you today. Pregnancy symptoms can differ significantly among women, and hormonal irregularities—which can also delay your period—often mimic those of early pregnancy. Sometimes, ovulation may not occur as expected due to various factors like weight fluctuations, travel, or stress that can disrupt your cycle.\n\nIn your specific situation, considering your husband's vasectomy, it seems unlikely that you are pregnant. The home pregnancy test you took is generally as reliable as those conducted in a doctor’s office.\n\nHowever, if you would find peace of mind, your husband could have a sperm count test to confirm the effectiveness of his vasectomy. I hope this information addresses your concerns and has been helpful.\n\nBest wishes,  \nDr. Brown",

                "text": "Certainly! Here is a rephrased version of the paragraph:\n\nPregnancy often brings symptoms such as frequent urination, nausea, and breast enlargement. My husband had a vasectomy four years ago. Over the past two weeks, I've experienced similar pregnancy-like signs: increased need to urinate, tender and swollen breasts, nausea, and my period is now delayed by two days. Even though I took a home pregnancy test last week which was negative, I'm still concerned. Additionally, there's been some slight white discharge. Is it possible for me to be pregnant?\n\nGreetings! Allow me to help you today. Pregnancy symptoms can vary widely among women, and hormonal imbalances—which may also cause menstrual delays—can resemble those of early pregnancy. Occasionally, ovulation might not take place as expected due to various reasons such as weight changes, travel, or stress that can disrupt your cycle.\n\nConsidering your husband's vasectomy, it appears improbable that you are pregnant. The home pregnancy test you used is usually just as accurate as one done at a doctor’s office.\n\nIf you would like reassurance, your husband could undergo a sperm count test to verify the success of his vasectomy. I hope this information alleviates any worries and has been useful.\n\nWarm regards,  \nDr. Brown",

Possible causes include thyroid issues, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), being overweight or obese, anemia, and stress, among others. Given your symptoms, it would be wise to consult with a doctor. They may conduct tests such as a blood count (Hb), thyroid profile, or ultrasound to identify the underlying cause.\n\nIf weight is a factor, focusing on weight reduction might help. It's also beneficial to manage stress levels and adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet and regular exercise.

It's understandable that this is confusing since your pregnancy test was negative.\n\nThere are several reasons why menstruation can be delayed aside from pregnancy, such as thyroid problems, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), being overweight or obese, anemia, and stress, among others. Considering your symptoms, it would be wise to see a doctor. They might recommend tests like a blood count (Hb), thyroid profile, or ultrasound to determine the underlying issue.\n\nIf weight is a contributing factor, focusing on reducing it could help. Managing stress levels and leading a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet and regular exercise are also beneficial. Don't worry too much; once the root cause is addressed, your menstrual cycle may return to normal. Please take care of yourself and try to relax.\n\nBest regards.",

As far as my knowledge goes, Primolut should not be prescribed as a progesterone supplement during pregnancy. This can cause virilization of a female fetus if used at the stage of organogenesis. It can also adversely effect the differentiation of the male sex organs. There are other, safer progesterone supplements like Duphaston, that can be used when needed. Please check with your doctor once again if the drug has been correctly prescribed or not. Since you are spotting, it is essential to take absolute bed rest, avoid all stressful situations and have regular follow up to know the pregnancy status. If the cause of the previous pregnancy loss can be known, it would be more useful. Hope this helps.",

Feel tired & lethargic. Hi,Welcome to HCM.The symptoms suggest pharyngitis progressing to bronchitis. Cough with phlegm leads to suspicion of lower respiratory tract infection. I suggest a mucolytic syrup to soften the phlegm and decrease the chest pain. Get a sputum culture and sensitivity done. Get a prescription for appropriate antibiotics for 7 days based on that report from a GP nearby you. If your cough and chest pain does not reduce within three days of treatment, you might have to get a chest Xray to rule out lower respiratory tract involvement. Thanks.",

Here's a rephrased version of the paragraph:\n\n---\n\nWhat could cause variations in bilirubin levels after receiving interferon therapy?\n\nHello Doctor,\n\nI was diagnosed with early-stage cirrhosis due to hepatitis C back in 2005 and subsequently underwent interferon therapy, successfully reaching SVR. Since then, I've had biannual blood tests and MRIs; the results have generally been normal except for a platelet count of 97,000. My latest blood test revealed a slight increase in direct bilirubin to .3 (reference range: 0-0.2).\n\nCould this suggest that my liver is starting to fail, or are there other potential causes for these changes in bilirubin levels? A bilirubin level of .3 doesn’t necessarily raise immediate concern. The fluctuations observed in your tests could be due to various factors. Currently, I don't see any indications of liver issues from these results. Continue monitoring your blood for any increase in enzymes (AST, ALT) or the virus's presence.\n\n---",

Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history.I would like to ask you a few more questions like - Does she have other allergies? Does she have wheezing after walking? Does she have chest pain, palpitation, excessive sweating, etc? However, from your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to your sister:1. If she has other allergies or wheezing, asthma is very likely. In that case, I would prescribe her salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-neede basis. I would also suggest her allergy testing so that she may identify the substances which are causing troubles to her and to avoid them. Regular breathing exercise will help her.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her to get her hemoglobin levels done. If they are low, they can cause breathing problem after heavy work/exercise. In that case, iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and other nutrition supplements will be useful.3. If any of above is not there, I would like to ask her symptoms in great detail to know whether she needs a cardiac evaluation. As she is young (29 years), anemia and asthma are more common possibilities rather than cardiac disease. However, it is important to diagnose the cause of her breathlessness.Hope above answer will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you sister the best of the health.Thank you & Regards.",

Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.By what you quote it should be an urticarial or a simple skin allergy.  Most important thing to be remembered is that it has a propensity to recur (called as second crop) within 10-14 days. I suggest you use calamine lotion as its giving results along with oral antiallergic like Hydroxyziine or Cetrizine. If this happens, you can start using the same medicine but I suggest you get the kid evaluated with your paediatrician.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

                "text": "magic the gathering What is it . how popular is it . who plays it . The culture behind it .. etc . etc I have been hearing more and more about it , and after last nights South Park episode I became curious what it is .. Please explain like I'm five. EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of \" teammate \" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is \" allied \" to two others and \" opposed \" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( \" weenies \" ) that can be used right away and \" buff\"-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) \" tutor \" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , \" fatties \" ) rather than with cheap ones ( \" weenies \" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or \" EDH \" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your \" commander \" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( \" Friday Night Magic \" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or \" mythic rare \" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the \" Deck - builder 's toolkit \" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of \" proxy \" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I 've only been playing for a year or so , and I do n't actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .",

Your AP Biology teacher mentioned them because, just like viruses, they can multiply without needing to eat or breathe. However, what makes prions unique is that they're special types of proteins—tiny building blocks in our bodies.\n\nProteins work by folding into specific shapes, which helps them do their jobs. This shape comes from a sequence of amino acids and how these proteins twist and turn on themselves or with the help of other helper molecules. Prions are tricky because they have the same amino acid sequence as normal proteins but fold in an unusual way. They can cause a domino effect, making other similar proteins misfold into their wrong shape.\n\nThese prion diseases include things like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and Mad Cow disease in cows, along with chronic wasting disease in deer. They all mess up the normal proteins in nerve cells (neurons). So yes, they can be quite a big deal because of how they disrupt normal protein functions.",

Your AP Biology teacher brought them up because, like viruses, they have the ability to replicate without consuming food or air. However, what sets prions apart is that they belong to a unique category of proteins—fundamental components in our bodies.\n\nProteins typically assume specific structures that enable their functions, with this structure deriving from an amino acid sequence and how these proteins coil or interact with other molecules for assistance. Prions are particularly deceptive because they share the same amino acid sequence as regular proteins but fold in an atypical manner. They can initiate a chain reaction, causing other similar proteins to misfold incorrectly.\n\nThese prion-related illnesses include conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, Mad Cow disease in cows, and chronic wasting disease in deer. All of these diseases interfere with the normal functioning of proteins within nerve cells (neurons).

Filming might only allow a park or road to be shut down for a few days at a time, but if a film needs access frequently, it's impractical.\n\nIf filming occurs in a busy public area, people often wander into the scene or gather closely to watch, which can disrupt filming. Sets help avoid this by controlling who has access.\n\nAlso, sets can be constructed with flexible designs, such as missing walls or special angles, allowing filmmakers to capture shots that aren't possible in real places.\n\nLastly, on a set, they have more control over potential issues like loud noises or needing to destroy something without disturbing actual locations.",

I 'm going to go off the assumption that you do n't know what tor is , if you do then feel free to skip the next paragraph . The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site .

Each node only knows about the previous and next hop in the journey, not the entire route or what you're doing online. This makes it look like your internet traffic is coming from somewhere else, hiding both where you are and your IP address.\n\nIn simple terms, a Tor node is one of these middle points that help disguise your location by making your data bounce around.

Holding a knife in the traditional way is better for reach and finesse, which helps keep opponents at bay. This grip is often weaker, easier to take away, and makes powerful strikes difficult. However, an assassin usually wants to deliver a deadly stab rather than a far-reaching slash, aiming for efficiency and impact. Plus, it just looks cooler! When everyone else holds a knife in the regular way, seeing someone do it differently suggests they have a specific reason and skill, enhancing their \"assassin\" image.

The main reasons are the quality and size differences in production. Beer bottles are made quickly on large machines, making them cheaper to produce and easier to transport because they're sturdy. On the other hand, wine glasses are delicate and require careful handling.\n\nAdditionally, beer bottles usually look pretty similar, so there's no extra charge for design work. But with wine glasses, designers can earn more money because each set might be unique or stylish, which adds to the cost. Plus, while there are expensive beers out there, you won't find very pricey basic wine glasses like at IKEA—those tend to be affordable.\n\nSo, it's all about how they're made and transported, along with some design costs!",

Beer bottles are produced rapidly on large machines, which reduces their manufacturing costs and facilitates easier transportation due to their durability. In contrast, wine glasses are fragile and necessitate careful handling.\n\nFurthermore, beer bottles generally have a uniform appearance, eliminating any additional design expenses. However, with wine glasses, designers can command higher fees as each set might be distinctive or fashionable, thereby increasing the price. Additionally, while there are high-end beers available, you won't find very expensive basic wine glasses like those at IKEA—these tend to remain budget-friendly.\n\nUltimately, it boils down to their production and transportation methods, along with some design-related costs!",

Lastly , brand names are sometimes changed because the name may have a different meaning in another culture which ( potentially ) has a negative or inappropriate connotation .

For instance, Honda originally named their car the Fitta, but they changed it because \"fitta\" means something rude in some Nordic languages.

But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous .",

Imagine you have some basic computer knowledge; here's an analogy to help explain how someone might try to track a person using TOR.\n\nA recent news article didn't go into much detail, but there is a more informative published paper that outlines an attack method in steps:\n\n1. A client (user) downloads a file from a server colluding with an attacker.\n2. During the download, the server sends repeating traffic patterns over the TCP connection visible to the exit node.\n3. After some time, the download stops and the traffic shaping ends.\n4. The attacker collects network data for both the server-to-exit traffic and the clients using the victim's entry node during this period.\n5. If these flows aren't perfectly aligned, the attacker uses an approximation strategy to adjust them.\n6. Next, the attacker calculates a correlation coefficient between the server-to-exit traffic and each client’s data at the entry node.\n7. The client with network statistics most correlated to the exit node's traffic is identified as the victim.\n\nIn simpler terms, if an entity like the NSA controlled a service accessed via TOR, they could manipulate packets to act as markers. Despite TOR encrypting and anonymizing data between nodes, control over many routers or major Internet exchange points might allow tracking from server to exit-node through intermediaries back to your original connection.\n\nTo make it super simple: imagine TOR as anonymous physical mail delivery rather than internet use. If a malicious sender (like the NSA) sends out very heavy parcels instead of regular letters, even if these are repackaged or relabeled by middlemen, their weight remains a giveaway. If this entity controls most postmen, they could identify unusual deliveries based on weight.\n\nThis approach relies on controlling the end server and monitoring major internet exchanges in near real-time—requiring handling vast data speeds (hundreds of gigabytes per second).\n\nTheoretically, TOR can be vulnerable, but the paper doesn't prove that such an attack is practically feasible for intercepting communications between two anonymous users.",

Suppose you possess some foundational computer knowledge; here's a helpful analogy to illustrate how one could potentially track a TOR user.\n\nA recent news report lacked depth, but a more detailed academic paper describes an attack method through specific steps:\n\n1. A user (client) downloads a file from a server in collusion with an attacker.\n2. During this download process, the server sends repetitive traffic patterns over the TCP connection that are visible to the exit node.\n3. The download eventually halts and the traffic shaping concludes.\n4. Meanwhile, the attacker gathers network data for both the server-to-exit node traffic and the clients using the victim's entry node during this interval.\n5. If these data flows don't align perfectly, the attacker employs an approximation strategy to adjust them.\n6. Subsequently, the attacker calculates a correlation coefficient between the server-to-exit node traffic and each client’s data at the entry node.\n7. The client whose network statistics most closely correlate with the exit node's traffic is pinpointed as the target.\n\nTo put it more plainly, if an organization like the NSA were to control a service accessed through TOR, they could manipulate packets to serve as identifiable markers. Even though TOR encrypts and anonymizes data between nodes, having influence over numerous routers or significant internet exchange points might permit tracking from server to exit-node via intermediaries back to your initial connection.\n\nTo make it even simpler: envision TOR as an anonymous physical mail delivery system rather than just digital communication. If a malicious sender (such as the NSA) dispatches very heavy parcels instead of regular letters, these could still be identified by their weight, even if they are repackaged or relabeled by intermediaries. Should this entity manage most postal workers, they could detect unusual deliveries based on their heft.\n\nThis method hinges on controlling the end server and monitoring major internet exchanges in near real-time—requiring the handling of immense data speeds (hundreds of gigabytes per second).\n\nWhile theoretically TOR may be susceptible to such vulnerabilities, the paper does not substantiate that this attack method is practically feasible for intercepting communications between two anonymous users.",

Another tactic involved patrolling near constricted areas like between islands or around sandbars. Large convoys generally followed predictable paths within specific latitudes that offered the quickest routes to and from Europe, taking into account trade winds and ocean currents.

Yellow paint takes in the blue light but shows the red and green light. Red paint soaks up the green and blue lights but shines out red light. When you mix them together, the result is a paint that takes away the blue light, keeps some of the green light, and shows red light.

The negative view often comes from their connection with GMOs (genetically modified organisms).

If you prefer not to agree to this, you can choose other seeds, though these might give a smaller harvest.\n\nIf pollen from Monsanto crops accidentally mixes with nearby plants, Monsanto doesn’t sue the farmer.

If this arrangement doesn't suit you, other seed options are available, though they may yield less produce.\n\nShould pollen from Monsanto crops inadvertently drift onto neighboring plants, Monsanto refrains from suing the farmer involved. Instead, they handle the expenses of cleanup and any crop losses incurred.\n\nIn truth, since 1997, Monsanto has been involved in 145 lawsuits, but only 11 reached a court trial.

Let me explain it simply. Amazon keeps their big storage places stocked with the most popular things people buy often. When you order something on Amazon from a store far away that's new to you, they grab an exact copy (if they have one ready) from the nearest storage place close to your home and send it out super fast. The item from that distant store then fills its spot in the storage center. That's why sometimes an item seems worn out in the description, but when it arrives, it looks much better than you thought!

Do they maintain massive warehouses throughout every state filled with all the items they sell? Let me clarify this simply. Amazon ensures their main warehouses are stocked with the most frequently purchased popular items. When you purchase something from a distant store that's new to you on Amazon, they dispatch an identical item (if available) from the nearest warehouse close to your home, ensuring rapid delivery. Meanwhile, an item from the remote store replenishes its place in the distribution center. This explains why sometimes an item appears worn out in the listing but arrives looking much better than expected! This system enables quick access to common items; however, if you order something very unique or uncommon, it must travel all the way from that store, through Amazon's network, and finally to your house, which takes significantly longer.

Because it works for the minority party . Why is it not simply dismissed ? No majority will eliminate it because they know it will be useful to them in the future . You 'll hear of the \" Nuclear Option \" from time to time , a threat to eliminate the filibuster by changing the rules ( by simple majority ) . So far , it has not happened . I would n't be surprised to see it happen in the next congress - the rise of use of filibuster is unprecedented ( the filibuster itself is less than 100 years old ) and scorched - earth politicking has become more and more common inside the beltway .

It's a powerful tool for smaller groups in the Senate because it works. The big groups don't get rid of it because they might need it themselves someday. Sometimes, there are talks about changing this rule using something called the \"Nuclear Option,\" which would require just 51 votes, but no one has done that yet.\n\nFilibustering is still young, under 100 years old, and used more than ever before as political battles heat up.

From what I understand about modern conflicts, you can't just leave AK-47s behind because civilians might take them. Can someone explain how all this extra military equipment is handled? Let me know like I'm five.\n\nHello there! If I were a US Army Infantryman currently stationed in Afghanistan, here's the scoop: In an infantry platoon, it’s up to the Platoon Sergeant to keep track of everyone and everything—people, weapons, and gear. They do this by keeping a special list called a MAL (master authorization list), which they get from the Company's Armorer when weapons are taken out of storage.\n\nWhen a soldier gets hurt or passes away during combat, he or she is placed on a MEDEVAC vehicle, like a helicopter or some type of ground transport. Before loading up, all their equipment is removed and kept by the unit. If they had an important weapon—like a machine gun with more firepower than the usual M4—it goes to the next most capable person along with any ammunition. This helps keep the team's effectiveness high, even if there are fewer people.\n\nAs for gear, once it’s brought back to a FOB (Forward Operating Base), it gets checked by experts to see if it can still be used. If an item isn’t good and the soldier is alive, they try to send that item home with them. It's common for soldiers who were hit in their helmets to keep those helmets forever.\n\nHandling enemy gear is different. Ideally, when we neutralize a threat and have time, a TSE team (Tactical Site Exploitation) collects enemy equipment at the scene, treating it like a crime scene—bagging, tagging, photographing, and sending it off to Military Intelligence for analysis. This helps figure out better ways to counter those weapons.\n\nSometimes, if there's no time, enemy gear is destroyed right away to make sure it can't be used against us.\n\nIn short, the Platoon Sergeant works hard to recover friendly equipment quickly and get it fixed. Enemy equipment is either analyzed by Military Intelligence or destroyed on the spot.",

Gasoline prices at the pump depend on the cost of oil plus shipping, refining, marketing, selling, and taxes. However, the price of oil is the most fluctuating factor.\n\nWhat's causing oil prices to drop? It's not easy to say for sure, but Saudi Arabia is producing more oil than usual and hasn't slowed down production to keep prices high.

Let me break it down simply: the main reason is the drop in oil prices. The cost per barrel decreased from around $100 in July to about $78, marking a reduction of more than 20%. Gasoline prices at the pump are influenced by various factors such as the cost of oil, shipping, refining, marketing, selling, and taxes. However, the price of oil is the most variable component.\n\nWhat has led to the decrease in oil prices? It's not straightforward to pinpoint an exact cause, but Saudi Arabia's increased production without cutting back on output to maintain high prices plays a significant role. Additionally, enhanced oil extraction in the US and Canada due to fracking technology contributes to this trend. Disregard any assertions linking it solely to election politics—neither the US alone can notably decrease global oil prices over such an extended timeframe.",

However, the situation is far more complex. Imagine explaining it simply: Russia desires a buffer state within part of what's known as the Polish Funnel, an area historically challenging to defend against invasions into Russia. Here’s a map (URL_0) showing European geography. The mountainous regions act like natural barriers that are tough for troops to navigate.\n\nTo prevent enemy forces from amassing on their side, it's strategic to control and protect the land behind these mountains. After the Soviet Union dissolved, Russia lost its first line of buffer states—Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania—to NATO, an organization viewed as adversarial by both sides (URL_1). This effectively diminished Russia’s natural geographical defenses.\n\nCurrently, Ukraine and Moldova remain outside NATO. Although Moldova isn't aligned with Russia either, Ukraine's strategic importance is significant due to its defensible location behind the Carpathian Mountains. Its borders with Russia could potentially open a large front for defense against European incursions. Thus, Russia aims to prevent Ukraine from joining both the EU and NATO and avoid hosting Western military bases and forces.\n\nIf completely stopping Ukraine from entering NATO isn't feasible, Russia's next best scenario is to divide the country, aligning eastern Ukraine with Russian interests as a smaller buffer zone.\n\n**TLDR:** The protective barriers around Russia are weakening as potential adversaries encroach. Ukraine represents a significant part of this barrier, which Russia wants to hold firm against falling into opposing hands.\n\n*Note: A better map can be found in the edit section.*",

Here’s a map (URL_0) illustrating European geography.

A better way to ask is, \"What's the downside of having wisdom teeth if you haven't had children yet?\" The answer: not much. It might seem like evolution should eliminate useless things over time, but it doesn't work that way. Evolution requires something to specifically select against an unnecessary trait. If wisdom teeth made people less appealing or more likely to die before reproducing, there would be evolutionary pressure to reduce their size. Over time, smaller wisdom teeth would become more common. Since this hasn’t happened, they're likely here to stay.\n\nThink of it like the appendix: if it's useless and potentially dangerous, why do we still have one? Because by the time an appendix becomes a problem, you've probably already had children and passed on your genes. If people typically got appendicitis when they were around five years old, there would be more pressure to get rid of the appendix over generations.",

One might assume evolution would phase out unnecessary features over time, but that isn’t exactly how it operates. Evolution demands specific selection against an unneeded trait.

Attending a grand jury is part of certain types of cases during a typical trial, though this can vary depending on the state. A grand jury consists of people whom the prosecutor needs to persuade that there's enough evidence to proceed with charges. The prosecutor doesn't need to prove the defendant's guilt at this stage; they just have to show there's sufficient reason to bring formal accusations. This process is meant to ensure a trial isn't pursued if someone seems clearly innocent, preventing charges from being used against those who are not guilty.

The debate arises because grand juries often find it easy to agree with the prosecutor's case, leading many to view them as more of a formality.

Some animals show different traits for males and females because they need these traits to survive and reproduce in their species. These traits can vary widely among species, with no fixed characteristics for either gender. For example, in many mammals, especially social ones, males are generally bigger, stronger, and more suited for aggression and conflict, while females are often better adapted for raising children (this is about biology, not society). In insects, it's usually the opposite: females tend to be larger and focus on child rearing, while males primarily serve sperm production.\n\nNow, back to facial differences in humans. Sexual selection has played a significant role in shaping these differences over time. Males are typically larger with broader shoulders, while women generally have wider hips and are shorter, with higher fat-to-muscle ratios. Historically, men were often seen as better fighters, and women as better caregivers, influencing who was chosen as a mate.\n\nAdditionally, these physical traits have influenced other facial features associated with attractiveness: men tend to have broader jawlines, while women often have softer facial features. These are generalizations based on social perceptions rather than exact science.\n\nIf a forensic investigator were to identify the gender of a head with no hair or eyelashes, they would rely on certain assumptions and look for traits like nose-to-eye width ratios.

In many animal species, males and females exhibit different traits necessary for their survival and reproduction. These differences can vary greatly among species, with no consistent traits across genders. For instance, in numerous mammals, particularly social ones, males usually have larger bodies, greater strength, and are more inclined towards aggression and conflict, while females are often better equipped for child-rearing (from a biological standpoint rather than societal). In contrast, many insects exhibit the reverse pattern: females are generally bigger and focus on raising offspring, whereas males are mainly involved in sperm production.\n\nReturning to human facial differences. Sexual selection has significantly influenced these distinctions over time. Males typically have larger builds with wider shoulders, while women often possess broader hips and shorter statures, with higher fat-to-muscle ratios. Traditionally, men were viewed as better combatants, and women as superior caregivers, influencing mate selection.\n\nThese physical traits have also affected other facial features associated with attractiveness: males usually have more prominent jawlines, whereas females tend to have softer facial contours. These observations are based on social perceptions rather than strict scientific evidence.\n\nIf a forensic expert needed to determine the gender of an unidentified head lacking hair or eyelashes, they would depend on certain assumptions and examine traits such as the ratio between nose width and eye spacing.

Can someone explain why we are n't saving tons of money by cutting these damn office lights off at night ? Please explain like I'm five. Because work goes on virtually every hour of every day in high rises . The office critters occupy and push papers and make up money during the daylight and sometimes into the evening . And Overnight / early morning there are cleaning crews maintenance / repair crews and construction crews and security people wandering about . The tenants in highrise office buildings are constantly changing , whenever a new tenant moves into a floor or subdivides a floor into multiple offices the work on the build out ca n't happen during the day since office critters would get upset if construction men were walking all over their desks and shifting stuff around while they were there . My company occasionally does high rise tenant finish and when the tenant wants a new break room or two , and the executive wants a private bathroom in his corner office then things need to be happening on multiple floors at once . The drainage piping needs to be run on the floor below , which is likely occupied . To install new drainage plumbing in a high rise a large X - ray machine needs to be brought out and shoot beams of radiation up towards the slab to find what locations are available for drilling , ( this needs to be done from the floor below ) then we bring out large core drills which make lots of noise and spray mud everywhere , which requires us to cover all the office folks computers and desks / cabinets and family photos with tarps so when they get back in the morning they do n't know we were romping around their office the previous night . Then we need to take the ceiling grid panels out from the occupied floor and bring in the equipment to install the new piping . Doing any of this during ' working hours ' , everything from bringing in large radiation machines and blasting them between their desks , to covering everyone with tarps and spraying them with mud which making a racket , would piss loads of workers off . Work like what I 'm describing will mean that three floors are completely lit up for the entire night shift , if it 's a 35 story building and 2 - 3 floors are being re - finished and there are two cleaning crews and a security / maintenance crew going around as well then that would mean 10 - 12 floors at a time minimum are lit up so people are able to work . Tl , DR : If the lights are on on a certain floor of a highrise , there are people doing some form of work on that floor , if there are no lights or the lights are dim then the floor is unoccupied at that time . I 've also heard rumors that tall buildings need to keep a certain amount of floors lit up so aeroplanes can see then easier and gauge their height / distance at night . Though I think this is less likely than work going on , tall buildings have those flashing red lights up top for planes .",

                "text": "Why do multistory office buildings and skyscrapers keep their lights on all the time? Why aren't we saving a lot of money by turning off these lights at night? Let me explain in simple terms. Work happens around the clock in tall buildings. During the day, people who work there—let's call them \"office critters\"—fill up files and handle business, sometimes staying late. At night, cleaning crews, maintenance teams, repair workers, construction teams, and security personnel are busy.\n\nThe tenants of high-rise office buildings often change. When a new tenant moves in or divides a floor into more offices, the setup work can't happen during regular hours because it would disturb everyone. For instance, my company occasionally finishes up high-rise spaces for new tenants. If they want a break room or an executive bathroom, work needs to be done on several floors simultaneously.\n\nTo install something like new plumbing, we need to use big machines that look through walls with radiation beams from the floor below to find where to drill, avoiding occupied areas. This requires loud drilling machines and messy mud, so we cover all furniture and electronics with tarps to prevent damage. We also remove ceiling panels for equipment access. Doing this during work hours would upset many employees because of the noise, mess, and disruption.\n\nSo, if lights are on in a certain part of a high-rise building, it means people are working there. If the lights are off or dim, that area is likely empty. Also, I've heard some say tall buildings keep lights on so planes can see them at night to judge their height or distance.

Wouldn't we save money by turning them off when they're not needed? Let me clarify in straightforward terms. Activities in tall buildings occur 24/7. During daylight hours, workers—let's call them \"office critters\"—manage paperwork and conduct business, sometimes staying late into the evening. At nighttime, cleaning staff, maintenance teams, repair crews, construction personnel, and security guards are all active.\n\nThe occupants of high-rise office spaces frequently change. When a new tenant arrives or partitions an area into additional offices, renovations cannot occur during normal hours to avoid disturbing others. For example, my company sometimes prepares high-rise spaces for new tenants. If they require amenities like break rooms or executive restrooms, work must be carried out across several floors simultaneously.\n\nFor tasks such as installing new plumbing, we use large machines that emit radiation beams from the floor below to detect safe drilling locations without disturbing occupied areas. This process involves noisy drills and messy mud, so we cover furniture and electronics with tarps for protection. Additionally, ceiling panels are removed for equipment access. Carrying out these activities during regular working hours would cause significant disruption due to noise, dirt, and disturbance.\n\nThus, if lights are on in a particular section of a high-rise building, it indicates that people are actively working there. If the lights are off or dimmed, that area is likely unoccupied. Moreover, while some suggest that tall buildings keep their lights on for aircraft visibility at night to gauge height or distance, this practice seems less common than ongoing work activities; instead, these structures typically use special flashing red lights for aviation safety.",

                "text": "Can US ever repay its national debt ? Is it possible to ever get the 17 or so trillion dollar debt back to 0 and how so ? Please explain like I'm five. I think it goes without saying that government is n't really anything like personal debt but it might help put things in perspective using a more familiar idea we can grasp . Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , \" yes , but you would n't really want to \" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 . Unfortunately , when we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 , that added expense sidelined the debt repayment and ballooned our debt . And then in 2008 and 2009 the financial crisis happened and various stimulus packages and tax relief packages meant our debt ballooned again . It 's really been a lousy decade for debt and deficit . But have no fear : Should we do the obvious yet politically suicidal thing of raising taxes and cutting spending we can get our debt under control again ( until the next big crisis , at least ) . But we do n't want to pay it off , mostly because a lot of our debt is n't owned by foreign countries : it 's owned by people like you and me in the form of government bonds . ( Basically you buy XX in IOUs from the government and they 'll pay you back XX plus interest after a given amount of time and these are generally seen as safe but low(er ) return parts of many investment portfolios for individuals and businesses . ) If the government is debt free , that means there are no bonds to invest in , which is n't very good for the economy . Economists might disagree on how much debt is good and how much is bad but most would agree that it 's best to have some . So that it . Our debt is big , but it 's not concerning because it 's about the same size as our GDP . It should probably be at least a little smaller , which is simple and hard because everyone knows what needs to be done ( higher taxes and lower spending ) but nobody is willing to do it . But much like needing to lose weight you ca n't just exercise more OR cut calories , you 've got to do both . And while we could one day , 20 , 30 years from now slowly get to zero with modest cuts and tax hikes , we do n't really need to or want to because it would mean lower , slower economic growth as a nation and fewer quality investment opportunities for individuals and businesses .",

                "text": "Can the US ever pay off its national debt? Is it feasible to reduce the approximately $17 trillion debt to zero, and if so, how? Let's explore this in simple terms. While government debt is different from personal debt, comparing them can provide some clarity.\n\nThe sheer size of our debt—$17,000,000,000,000—can be intimidating. But here’s an interesting fact: our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or what the country produces annually, is also around $17 trillion. Think of GDP as the nation's yearly income. If someone earned $170,000 a year and had the same amount in debt for things like a home and credit cards but always paid their bills on time, people would consider them financially stable. As long as that person’s income grows with their debt, they’d likely continue to qualify for loans.\n\nNow, can the national debt be repaid? The straightforward answer is \"yes,\" but it's not necessarily desirable. If we use a house analogy, paying off our debt could mean cutting back on spending and using savings to reduce what we owe. However, identifying non-essential expenses to cut can be challenging because most of what we spend money on is necessary.\n\nOn a national scale, reducing expenditures like a $10 million budget for ketchup research seems insignificant when you’re dealing with trillions. Although it's not impossible, significant efforts are needed. For instance, during the Clinton administration in the late 1990s, there was a plan to reduce national debt through tax increases and spending cuts. By raising taxes and cutting expenses, they aimed to eliminate the debt by 2011. However, military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq, followed by the financial crisis in 2008-2009, increased our debt instead.\n\nWhile we could theoretically manage this issue by increasing taxes and reducing spending again, it’s politically challenging. Additionally, much of our national debt is held domestically through government bonds, which many people invest in as safe assets with modest returns. If there were no debt, these investment opportunities would disappear, affecting the economy negatively.\n\nEconomists often debate how much debt is optimal, but they generally agree that some level of debt can be beneficial. The key takeaway is that our national debt is substantial yet comparable to our GDP. Ideally, it should be smaller, achievable by raising taxes and cutting spending—though this approach is politically difficult. Similar to losing weight, addressing both sides (reducing expenses and increasing income) is necessary for long-term health. While we could gradually eliminate the debt over decades with careful fiscal measures, doing so might slow economic growth and reduce investment opportunities. Hence, while possible, completely paying off national debt may not be desirable or necessary in the short term.",

There were two main issues with Steam, and neither of Valve's solutions really worked out well:\n\n1. Getting a game on Steam was kind of like hitting the lottery or magic—it was so unclear how it happened that most independent developers couldn't get their games onto the platform unless they were supported by big companies like EA or Ubisoft. This situation left many indie developers out in the cold, so Valve introduced Greenlight as a way to gauge popularity. Unfortunately, it got exploited, which led them to reconsider.\n\n2. In response, Valve implemented Early Access, which seems to be functioning reasonably well. However, they never actually removed Greenlight, even though they had mentioned plans to do so.\n\nLastly, Valve opened up the platform for all kinds of publishers to sell their older, less popular games on Steam. This move prompted a complete redesign of Steam's front page, taking about six months to complete. Not exactly a quick fix from Valve!",

To get a better understanding I suggest you learn what an \" injection \" , a \" surjection \" , and a \" bijection \" is . ( A bijection is a function which is in a one - to - one correspondence .

So, we say the set of natural numbers and the set of even numbers have the same \"size\" or \"cardinality,\" even though all even numbers are part of the natural numbers. \n\nHowever, when it comes to natural numbers and real numbers, no one-to-one match exists. This means their sizes differ in a way, with real numbers being larger. Every natural number can be paired with at least one real number (like 0 with 0, 1 with 1), so the set of real numbers is considered bigger.\n\nIt's not possible to pair every real number with a natural number. To better grasp this idea, it helps to learn what \"injection,\" \"surjection,\" and \"bijection\" mean. A bijection is when there's an exact one-to-one match. And you can prove a function is a bijection if it works as both a surjection (covers all elements) and an injection (is unique).\n\nI hope that makes it clearer!",

Each natural number can be matched with at least one real number (like 0 matches with 0, and 1 with 1), suggesting that the collection of real numbers is more extensive.\n\nIt's impossible to create a pairing where every real number corresponds to a natural number.

Let me explain as if you're five. Hello there! I’m a pathologist, and you have an upper respiratory infection. The word \"cold\" actually refers to many different viruses that all cause similar symptoms. Viruses need to reproduce inside a host cell. They use the cell's machinery to make copies of themselves and then burst out, destroying the cell.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a perfect metaphor; it’s just for educational purposes. Critiques will be taken with humor on Fridays. Imagine a virus as a zombie in a crowded shopping mall—your throat. It wanders in looking terrible. A teen girl laughs. A businessman walks by talking on his phone, ignoring the seemingly drunk homeless person. Security hasn’t noticed yet.\n\nWhen the virus first entered your throat, your immune system didn't recognize it immediately. Then, the zombie bites someone! Someone screams! Security rushes over and tries to subdue what they think is a drugged person. (It’s worth noting that usually, one viral particle isn’t enough to cause an infection—it's more likely you inhaled airborne particles from someone else's snot or spit filled with viruses.)\n\nSo, imagine ten more zombies emerging into the chaos. Panic ensues. People are confused and scared. The immune cells haven't figured out what’s happening yet. Security frantically shoots at the zombies without effect because they're not familiar with this particular virus.\n\nThose who get bitten soon become zombies too, and their numbers grow rapidly. Not everyone bitten by a zombie dies; some people in your body sacrifice themselves to stop the infection from spreading further. Some infected cells can mark themselves for destruction. Emergency services haven't arrived yet.\n\nYour throat might swell up later as part of an immune response. But right now, your nerves sense something is wrong because of cell damage. People are hiding and calling their loved ones. The situation isn’t widespread enough to cause severe pain—just localized discomfort in the area where it started, so you feel an itch rather than intense pain.\n\nI suspect you haven't reached the peak of your symptoms yet.

The term \"cold\" actually covers numerous viruses that produce similar symptoms. Viruses need to multiply within a host cell. They hijack the cell's machinery to replicate themselves before bursting out, killing the cell in the process.\n\nDisclaimer: This is just a metaphor for educational purposes and isn’t entirely accurate; feedback can be shared humorously on Fridays. Picture a virus as a zombie wandering around a bustling shopping mall—your throat. A teen girl chuckles at it. Meanwhile, a businessman strides by on his phone, ignoring an apparently inebriated homeless person. Security is yet to take notice.\n\nWhen the virus first invaded your throat, your immune system didn’t recognize it immediately. Suddenly, the zombie bites someone! Panic erupts as people scream! Security arrives and tries to restrain what they think is a drugged individual.

Chaos ensues. People are disoriented and frightened. The immune cells are still trying to understand what’s happening. Security frantically shoots at the zombies, but it’s ineffective as they're unfamiliar with this specific virus.\n\nThose who get bitten soon turn into zombies too, rapidly increasing their numbers. Not everyone bitten by a zombie perishes; some of your body's cells sacrifice themselves to prevent further spread of the infection. Some infected cells can flag themselves for destruction. Emergency services are yet to arrive.\n\nYour throat might swell later as part of an immune response. For now, your nerves detect damage due to cell injury. People begin seeking refuge and contacting their loved ones. The disturbance isn’t severe enough to cause intense pain—just a localized itch where it started. \n\nI believe you haven't reached the worst of your symptoms yet.

It would be less bulky at least. Imagine explaining this to a five-year-old: while burning trash might seem like a good way to reduce its size, it's not cost-effective for most places on Earth because we don't run out of space. But that’s not really why we don’t do it. Sweden actually buys trash from nearby countries because they are so good at recycling and managing waste, and their incinerators help produce energy. However, setting up and running incinerators can be very expensive. It only makes sense if it turns a profit. Since dumping trash in areas with plenty of space is cheap, incinerators have to compete with that cost and also with other affordable ways to generate power. Even though burning trash might be the environmentally friendly choice, markets aren’t motivated by ethics or morals; they are driven purely by profits. To give an example, a local energy company once launched a false campaign against building a waste-burning facility near me about 25 years ago, and it was never even used.\n\nLet me know if you need any more changes!",

It would be less voluminous, at least. To explain this to a young child: while burning trash might appear as an effective way to decrease its bulk, it's generally not financially viable for most regions globally because we haven't yet depleted available landfill space. However, that isn’t the primary reason we don’t pursue this method. In fact, Sweden purchases waste from neighboring countries due to their superior recycling and waste management systems; their incinerators also generate energy. Nonetheless, constructing and operating these facilities can be quite costly. They only become viable if they are profitable. Since landfilling is inexpensive in areas with ample space, incinerators must compete against this cost as well as other low-cost power generation methods. Although incineration might be the more environmentally conscious option, markets are not driven by ethics or morals but purely by profits. For instance, around 25 years ago, a local energy company falsely campaigned against building a waste-burning plant near my area, which was never utilized.\n\nFeel free to request any further adjustments!",

Others might live on fault lines with a high risk of earthquakes cutting off power or reside in isolated areas.\n\nThen there are those who think about all sorts of conspiracy theories that don't make much sense. \n\nAnd some just like it as a hobby, because it helps them meet new people and learn useful skills like first aid or hunting.",

They search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query. The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs). When a user enters a query into a search engine, the engine scans its index of web pages to find those that are relevant to the user's query. The results are then ranked by relevancy and displayed to the user. The information may be a mix of links to web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories and social bookmarking sites, which are maintained by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler.

It was originally developed in 1996 by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan. In 2011, Google introduced \"Google Voice Search\" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words. In 2012, Google introduced a Knowledge Graph semantic search feature.Analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic, social and health trends.[10] Data about the frequency of use of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys.

Users can enhance its functionality by installing \"skills,\" which are third-party features similar to apps, for additional services like weather and audio enhancements. Utilizing automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and other forms of weak AI, Alexa performs these tasks.\n\nMost devices with Alexa use a wake-word such as \"Alexa\" or \"Amazon\" to activate, though others like the Amazon mobile app on iOS or Android, and Amazon Dash Wand require pressing a button to enter listening mode. Some phones can also be activated by voice commands like \"Alexa.\" By November 2018, over 10,000 employees at Amazon were focused on developing Alexa and related products. As of January 2019, the company's devices team reported sales surpassing 100 million units equipped with Alexa.\n\nIn September 2019, Amazon introduced several new devices that set records in the global smart home industry. These included the Echo Studio, the first smart speaker with 360-degree sound and Dolby technology, an Echo Dot featuring a clock behind its fabric cover, a third-generation Amazon Echo, Echo Show 8, plug-in Echo device Echo Flex, wireless earphones named Echo Buds with built-in Alexa, spectacles called Echo Frames integrated with Alexa, an Alexa-enabled Ring known as Echo Loop, among others.",

Self-driving cars use sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as optical and thermographic cameras, radar, lidar, ultrasound/sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. Control systems interpret sensory information to create a three-dimensional model of the surroundings. Based on the model, the car identifies appropriate navigation paths, and strategies for managing traffic controls (stop signs, etc.) and obstacles.[10][11]Once the technology matures, autonomous vehicles are predicted to impact the automobile industry, health, welfare, urban planning, traffic, insurance, labor market and other fields. Autonomy in vehicles is often divided into six levels,[12] according to a system developed by SAE International (SAE J3016).[13] The SAE levels can be roughly understood as Level 0 – no automation; Level 1 – hands on/shared control; Level 2 – hands off; Level 3 – eyes off; Level 4 – mind off, and Level 5 – steering wheel optional.As of December 2022[update], vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor. In December 2020, Waymo became the first service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in a part of Phoenix, Arizona. In March 2021, Honda was the first manufacturer to sell a legally approved Level 3 car.[14][15][16] Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[17] In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz received approval for a Level 3 car.[18] In February 2022, Cruise became the second service provider to offer driver-less taxi rides to the general public, in San Francisco.[19]As of December 2022[update], several manufacturers had scaled back plans for self-driving technology, including Ford and Volkswagen.[20]",

The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.The playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections (points) of a board. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone or group is captured. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move. When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also be terminated by resignation.The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9×9 and 13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17×17 grid.

Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel's Checker's Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969–1986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988–2011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant's PAC learning, Quinlan's ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]Neural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt's perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: \"Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn't work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.\"[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]",

The basic method that the computers take in and respond to their environment is through the attached hardware.  Until recently input was limited to a keyboard, or a mouse, but advances in technology, both in hardware and software, have allowed computers to take in sensory input in a way similar to humans.Machine perception allows the computer to use this sensory input, as well as conventional computational means of gathering information, to gather information with greater accuracy and to present it in a way that is more comfortable for the user. These include computer vision, machine hearing, machine touch, and machine smelling, as artificial scents are, at a chemical compound, molecular, atomic level, indiscernible and identical.The end goal of machine perception is to give machines the ability to see, feel and perceive the world as humans do and therefore for them to be able to explain in a human way why they are making their decisions, to warn us when it is failing and more importantly, the reason why it is failing. This purpose is very similar to the proposed purposes for artificial intelligence generally, except that machine perception would only grant machines limited sentience, rather than bestow upon machines full consciousness, self-awareness, and intentionality.",

It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.Reasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.In contrast to the use of \"reason\" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, \"morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.\"Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.",

It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:Church, Kleene, and Turing[11] proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).On the other hand, the Church–Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.Since its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below).",

Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, OM, FRS[66] (18 May 1872 – 2 February 1970), was a prominent British figure in mathematics, philosophy, logic, and public discourse. His contributions significantly influenced disciplines such as mathematics, logic, set theory, linguistics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science, and various branches of analytic philosophy—especially concerning the philosophy of mathematics, language, epistemology, and metaphysics.[67][68] As a leading logician in the early 20th century, Russell was pivotal in establishing analytic philosophy along with predecessors like Gottlob Frege, colleagues such as G. E. Moore, and his student Ludwig Wittgenstein. He played an important role in the British \"revolt against idealism\".[b] Together with former mentor A. N. Whitehead, Russell co-authored Principia Mathematica, a foundational work in classical logic that aimed to ground all of mathematics in logic (see Logicism). His essay \"On Denoting\" is regarded as a landmark in philosophy.[70]\n\nRussell was a staunch pacifist and advocated against imperialism, serving as the president of the India League.[71][72][73] He occasionally supported preventive nuclear war until he came to see world government as a more practical solution once the atomic monopoly concluded.[74] His dedication to pacifism led to his imprisonment during World War I.[75] Later, Russell assessed that combatting Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany was an unavoidable \"lesser of two evils\" and criticized Stalinist totalitarianism. He also opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and fervently advocated for nuclear disarmament.[76]\n\nIn 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought\".[77][78] Furthermore, he received accolades including the De Morgan Medal (1932), Sylvester Medal (1934), Kalinga Prize (1957), and Jerusalem Prize (1963).",

It has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power. These activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field of application, and they have undergone substantial development over the past few decades.Pattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled \"training\" data. When no labeled data are available, other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and signal processing into consideration. It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.In machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes (for example, determine whether a given email is \"spam\"). Pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.Pattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform \"most likely\" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to pattern matching algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors.",

More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.Every academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. Each uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. New ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages.For instance, the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics, but also in other subfields of economics. An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much (see risk management).What ontologies in both computer science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in computer science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence).Applied ontology is considered a successor to prior work in philosophy, however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles, the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes.

Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases.The OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL and RDF have attracted significant academic, medical and commercial interest.In October 2007, a new W3C working group was started to extend OWL with several new features as proposed in the OWL 1.1 member submission. W3C announced the new version of OWL on 27 October 2009. This new version, called OWL 2, soon found its way into semantic editors such as Protégé and semantic reasoners such as Pellet, RacerPro, FaCT++[10] and HermiT.[11]The OWL family contains many species, serializations, syntaxes and specifications with similar names. OWL and OWL2 are used to refer to the 2004 and 2009 specifications, respectively. Full species names will be used, including specification version (for example, OWL2 EL).

Introduced by Raymond Reiter, default logic is a form of non-monotonic logic that models reasoning based on default assumptions. It allows for propositions like “by default, something holds true,” which differs from traditional logic that only supports claims that are either true or false. This creates challenges because many reasoning scenarios involve facts that apply generally but not universally. For example, the assertion \"birds typically fly\" cannot be represented in standard logic without inconsistencies: stating \"all birds fly\" is inaccurate as penguins can't fly, while saying “all birds except for penguins and ostriches, among others, can fly” requires listing all exceptions explicitly. Default logic aims to formalize such inference rules without the need to list every exception clearly.",

Not all words in one language have equivalent words in another language, and many words have more than one meaning. Solving this problem with corpus statistical and neural techniques is a rapidly growing field that is leading to better translations, handling differences in linguistic typology, translation of idioms, and the isolation of anomalies.[failed verification]Current machine translation software often allows for customization by domain or profession (such as weather reports), improving output by limiting the scope of allowable substitutions.

It follows that machine translation of government and legal documents more readily produces usable output than machine translation of conversation or less standardised text.Improved output quality can also be achieved by human intervention: for example, some systems are able to translate more accurately if the user has unambiguously identified which words in the text are proper names. With the assistance of these techniques, MT has proven useful as a tool to assist human translators and, in a very limited number of cases, can even produce output that can be used as is (e.g., weather reports).The progress and potential of machine translation have been much debated through its history.

A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources.

It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.Some speech recognition systems require \"training\" (also called \"enrollment\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called \"speaker-independent\" systems. Systems that use training are called \"speaker dependent\".Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. \"call home\"), call routing (e.g. \"I would like to make a collect call\"), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).The term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.From the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations. Most recently, the field has benefited from advances in deep learning and big data. The advances are evidenced not only by the surge of academic papers published in the field, but more importantly by the worldwide industry adoption of a variety of deep learning methods in designing and deploying speech recognition systems.",

Such a system is typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, and works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.Development began on similar systems in the 1960s, beginning as a form of computer application. Since their inception, facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology, such as robotics. Because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of a human's physiological characteristics, facial recognition systems are categorized as biometrics. Although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition and fingerprint recognition, it is widely adopted due to its contactless process. Facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced human–computer interaction, video surveillance and automatic indexing of images.Facial recognition systems are employed throughout the world today by governments and private companies. Their effectiveness varies, and some systems have previously been scrapped because of their ineffectiveness. The use of facial recognition systems has also raised controversy, with claims that the systems violate citizens' privacy, commonly make incorrect identifications, encourage gender norms and racial profiling, and do not protect important biometric data. The appearance of synthetic media such as deepfakes has also raised concerns about its security. These claims have led to the ban of facial recognition systems in several cities in the United States. As a result of growing societal concerns, Meta announced that it plans to shut down Facebook facial recognition system, deleting the face scan data of more than one billion users.

It goes beyond just analyzing texts by incorporating other modalities like audio and visual data. This method can be bimodal, merging two different types of modalities, or trimodal, involving three. Given the extensive social media content available online in various formats such as videos and images, conventional text-based sentiment analysis has progressed into more complex multimodal models. These advanced models are used in fields like virtual assistant development, YouTube movie review assessment, news video evaluation, emotion recognition (also known as emotion detection), and depression monitoring. Similar to traditional sentiment analysis, a key task in multimodal sentiment analysis is sentiment classification, which involves categorizing sentiments into groups such as positive, negative, or neutral. For analyzing text, audio, and visual features, various fusion techniques like feature-level, decision-level, and hybrid fusion are employed. The effectiveness of these fusion techniques and the classification algorithms used depends on the specific textual, audio, and visual features analyzed.",

For example, the rule of inference called modus ponens takes two premises, one in the form \"If p then q\" and another in the form \"p\", and returns the conclusion \"q\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.Typically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary ω-rule.Popular rules of inference in propositional logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and contraposition. First-order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers.",

Generally, an inference rule maintains truth, which is a semantic trait. In systems of many-valued logic, it preserves a broader designation instead. However, the operation of an inference rule is strictly syntactic and does not necessarily preserve any semantic property; any function that maps sets of formulae to other formulae qualifies as an inference rule. Usually, only those rules that are recursive hold significance—rules for which there exists a practical method to determine if a specific formula can be derived from a set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a non-recursive rule is the infinitary ω-rule. Common inference rules in propositional logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and contraposition. In first-order predicate logic, such rules are applied to handle logical quantifiers.",

Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size. Less common, and usually specified explicitly, is the average-case complexity, which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size (this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size). In both cases, the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input.: 226  Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly, and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential, one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases—that is, the asymptotic behavior of the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typically O(n){\\displaystyle O(n)}, O(nlog⁡n){\\displaystyle O(n\\log n)}, O(nα){\\displaystyle O(n^{\\alpha })}, O(2n){\\displaystyle O(2^{n})}, etc., where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the input.Algorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation.

It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found.For example, hill climbing can be applied to the travelling salesman problem. It is easy to find an initial solution that visits all the cities but will likely be very poor compared to the optimal solution. The algorithm starts with such a solution and makes small improvements to it, such as switching the order in which two cities are visited. Eventually, a much shorter route is likely to be obtained.Hill climbing finds optimal solutions for convex problems – for other problems it will find only local optima (solutions that cannot be improved upon by any neighboring configurations), which are not necessarily the best possible solution (the global optimum) out of all possible solutions (the search space). Examples of algorithms that solve convex problems by hill-climbing include the simplex algorithm for linear programming and binary search.: 253  To attempt to avoid getting stuck in local optima, one could use restarts (i.e. repeated local search), or more complex schemes based on iterations (like iterated local search), or on memory (like reactive search optimization and tabu search), or on memory-less stochastic modifications (like simulated annealing).The relative simplicity of the algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node. Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as simulated annealing or tabu search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well. Hill climbing can often produce a better result than other algorithms when the amount of time available to perform a search is limited, such as with real-time systems, so long as a small number of increments typically converges on a good solution (the optimal solution or a close approximation). At the other extreme, bubble sort can be viewed as a hill climbing algorithm (every adjacent element exchange decreases the number of disordered element pairs), yet this approach is far from efficient for even modest N, as the number of exchanges required grows quadratically.

Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the traveling salesman problem, the boolean satisfiability problem, protein structure prediction, and job-shop scheduling). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent or branch and bound.The name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its physical properties. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy.Simulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, it could be enough for many practical problems.The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function.Similar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., Vecchi, for a solution of the traveling salesman problem. They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero.The simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for density functions or by using the stochastic sampling method.
