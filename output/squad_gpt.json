Around 21–24% of these students were alumni's children. While 37% hailed from the Midwestern United States, the student population represented all 50 states and over 100 countries.\n\nIn March 2007, The Princeton Review ranked Notre Dame as the fifth most preferred school for parents to send their children, but this ranking fell to ninth by March 2015. Although historically criticized for its lack of diversity, the university received high praise from The Princeton Review for being a place where \"Alternative Lifestyles [are] Not an Alternative.\" Some outlets have commended Notre Dame's diversity initiatives: in 2004, Hispanic Magazine ranked it ninth among top colleges for Latinos, and The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education noted its increased African-American student enrollment in 2006.\n\nNotre Dame is home to the largest intramural sports program with 6,000 participants. Sports Illustrated named Notre Dame's program as the best in the nation in 2004, while The Princeton Review recognized it for \"Everyone Plays Intramural Sports\" in 2007. Annually, Notre Dame hosts the Bookstore Basketball tournament, considered the world's largest outdoor five-on-five basketball event with over 700 teams participating each year. Additionally, the Notre Dame Men’s Boxing Club organizes the Bengal Bouts tournament to support Holy Cross Missions in Bangladesh.",

Jody Rosen emphasizes the distinctiveness of her tone and timbre, calling her voice \"one of the most captivating instruments in popular music.\" Another critic labels her a \"vocal acrobat,\" noting her adeptness at executing complex melismas and runs while staying on pitch. Her exceptional vocal talent positions her as the focal point of Destiny's Child. The Daily Mail describes Beyoncé's voice as \"versatile,\" proficient in power ballads, soul, rock belting, operatic nuances, and hip hop. Jon Pareles from The New York Times characterizes her voice as \"velvety yet tart, with a consistent flutter and the depth of soulful belting.\" Rosen points out that Beyoncé's rhythmic vocal style is heavily influenced by the hip-hop era while she also embraces traditional elements such as balladry, gospel, and falsetto. Other critics commend her range and power; Chris Richards from The Washington Post remarks that she can \"enhance any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or powerful diva-roars.\"",

The formal designation came about through efforts from the Montana Federation of Garden Clubs and support from the state forester.\n\nIn 1930, schoolchildren voted for the western meadowlark to become the state bird, a decision ratified by the legislature in 1931. In 1981, under a vote organized by the secretary of state involving children, the grizzly bear was selected as the state animal by a margin of 2–1 over the elk from among 74 nominations.\n\nAdditionally, Livingston students spearheaded a statewide petition and lobbied both the governor and legislature in 1985 to designate Maiasaura as the state fossil.",

In May 1839, they spent the summer at Sand's estate in Nohant, frequently visiting until 1846. With the arrival of autumn, they returned to Paris; Chopin settled at 5 rue Tronchet, near Sand’s apartment on rue Pigalle. They continued their routine visits while maintaining separate residences. By 1842, both had relocated to the Square d'Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.",

In 1836, Schumann, reviewing Chopin's piano concertos, emphasized the composer's profound connection to Poland, stating, \"As the Poles deeply grieve following the November 1830 uprising, their appeal to us artists grows stronger... Should the powerful northern ruler [Nicholas I of Russia] recognize that Chopin's mazurkas conceal a hidden adversary within their simple melodies, he would surely prohibit his music. Chopin’s compositions are like cannons masquerading as flowers!\" A biography from 1863, attributed to Franz Liszt (likely penned by Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein), asserted that Chopin \"deserves acclaim among the greatest musicians, embodying within himself the poetic essence of an entire nation.\"",

While many Han Chinese advisors held significant sway beyond their official roles, their status was unclear. Kublai Khan ended China's traditional imperial examinations, a practice not resumed until Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan's reign (1311–1320). As Rossabi points out, Kublai recognized the importance of utilizing Chinese advisors and officials for effective governance in China. However, he could not rely on them exclusively; it was essential to balance managing the settled Chinese civilization while preserving Mongol cultural identity and values. Throughout his reign, his focus shifted between serving his Chinese subjects' interests and exploiting empire resources for personal gain.\n\nAccording to Van Praag in *The Status of Tibet*, a dual governance system with an interdependent relationship existed between Tibetans and Mongols, legitimizing the succession of Mongol khans as universal Buddhist rulers or chakravartins. He notes that \"Tibet remained a distinct part of the Empire and was never fully integrated into it,\" citing instances like a licensed border market between China and Tibet during the Yuan dynasty.",

Chen Qingying notes that Tsongkhapan communicated his decision in a letter detailing the reasons for rejecting the Emperor’s invitation.",

However, Wang and Nyima contest this view, asserting these were not genuine diplomatic missions; rather, Tibetan territories were managed by the Ming, with their leaders serving as officials within the Ming administration. They propose that horse collection from Tibet acted as a \"corvée\" tax, indicating Tibetans undertook domestic duties instead of participating in foreign diplomacy. Sperling notes that while the Ming acquired horses in Kham and fought Tibetan tribes in Amdo, they also received Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He argues that these lama-led missions primarily promoted commercial interactions between their affluent entourages and Ming merchants and officials.\n\nKolmaš points out that although the Ming took a laissez-faire stance towards Tibet while restricting Tibetan retinues' size, Tibetans pursued a tributary relationship with the Ming for its economic and power benefits. Laird highlights that Tibetans were keen to accept invitations from the Ming court because the received gifts upon presenting tribute far exceeded their value.\n\nRegarding Yongle Emperor's presents—silver items, Buddha relics, temple utensils, and monastic garments—to Tibetan and Nepalese vassals, Tsai remarks that \"In his effort to integrate neighboring states into the Ming sphere of influence to enhance his prestige, the Yongle Emperor was willing to bear minor costs.\"",

He notes that early 20th-century Chinese scholars believed Tibet was not integrated into China until the Qing dynasty's Manchu conquest in the 18th century, describing Tibet as a feudal dependency rather than an integral part of China. Sperling clarifies this by stating, \"Tibet was governed under the Mongol and Manchu empires,\" without any Ming dynasty control over Tibet. He emphasizes the challenges this poses to China's claim of continuous sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. Addressing the Tibetan view that it never fell under Yuan or Qing rule, Sperling argues that Tibet was \"administered according to the laws and decrees of the Yuan and Qing rulers,\" pointing out that even Tibetans acknowledged their status as subjects under these emperors.",

Despite Goldstein noting that Güshi Khan granted the Dalai Lama \"supreme authority,\" he was also titled 'King of Tibet,' residing north of Lhasa in summer and within it during winter. Van Praag highlights that although Güshi Khan led the military, he recognized his subordinate role to the Dalai Lama.\n\nRawski indicates that initially, the Dalai Lama shared power with both his regent and Güshi Khan during his dual spiritual and secular governance. However, Rawski contends that the Dalai Lama later \"expanded his influence by embodying Avalokiteśvara through rituals,\" constructing the Potala Palace on consecrated sites, and reinforcing lineage reincarnation via written biographies.\n\nGoldstein states that under Güshi Khan's and the Dalai Lama’s rule, the Karma Kagyu sect was suppressed by seizing their property and transforming their monasteries into Gelug institutions. Rawski posits that Mongol support enabled the Gelugpas to prevail over other Tibetan religious factions.",

Nintendo of America informed Aonuma that the North American sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish due to its cartoonish visuals, which indicated it targeted a younger demographic. To avoid repeating this issue with the sequel, Aonuma discussed with producer Shigeru Miyamoto his interest in creating a more realistic Zelda game appealing to the North American audience. Although cautious about altering only the game's presentation, Miyamoto suggested focusing on gameplay innovations.

This dispute arose when Fleming integrated elements from an unfinished film script by McClory and screenwriter Jack Whittingham into his novel *Thunderball*, leading McClory to challenge this in court over rights claims. In 1963, Fleming settled out of court with McClory, granting him the film rights. Consequently, McClory became a producer for the 1965 *Thunderball* movie, alongside executive producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and later for the non-Eon remake *Never Say Never Again* in 1983. A planned second adaptation, titled *Warhead 2000 A.D.*, was set to be produced in the 1990s but was ultimately scrapped. The settlement terms allowed Fleming to retain literary rights, ensuring that the Spectre organization and its characters continued to appear in print.",

The low back chain shift also causes the [ɔ] sound in words like talk and law to tense and rise more than in General American. In traditional New York speech, \"girl\" and \"oil\" could become diphthongs [ɜɪ], sometimes leading outsiders to mishear them as \"goil\" and \"erl,\" respectively.

Sykes warmly welcomes them. Throughout the proceedings, Atticus reveals that Mayella Ewell and her father Bob—known locally as an alcoholic—are fabricating their accusations. It is also revealed that Mayella, who is friendless and isolated, made unwelcome advances toward Tom, leading to a beating by her father when he discovered it. Despite strong evidence proving Tom's innocence, the jury finds him guilty. This outcome devastates Jem’s belief in justice, along with Atticus’, especially after Tom is shot while attempting to flee from prison.",

                "text": "Scholars categorize *To Kill a Mockingbird* as both a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story. The eerie characteristics of Boo Radley and his residence, along with Tom Robinson's experience of racial injustice, infuse the narrative with Gothic elements. Lee describes Maycomb's courthouse architecture using \"Gothic\" terminology and incorporates Dill’s hyperbolic accounts of Boo Radley. In Southern Gothic literature, outsider figures are pivotal; similarly, Scout and Jem's examination of social structures invites comparisons to *Catcher in the Rye* and *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*. Although Scout questions societal norms, she views Atticus as an ultimate authority due to his focus on conscience rather than fear of ostracism. However, debates persist among scholars regarding its classification as Southern Gothic, given Boo Radley’s portrayal as humane, protective, and compassionate. Lee addresses themes such as alcoholism, incest, rape, and racial violence realistically, illustrating personal challenges as mirrors of broader societal issues.",

                "text": "Charles Shields, author of the definitive biography on Harper Lee, attributes the lasting appeal and impact of her novel to its universal themes concerning human dignity and respect for others. Atticus imparts a vital lesson to Scout: understanding another person can be achieved by seeing from their perspective—by metaphorically stepping into their shoes—which showcases his empathy. This advice lingers with Scout during Mayella Ewell's testimony, prompting her to reflect on Atticus' question about Mayella having any friends; she infers that Mayella might be even more secluded than Boo Radley. After leading Boo home following the rescue, Scout reassesses the previous three years from his viewpoint while standing on the Radley porch. An analyst notes that despite the novel addressing issues of tragedy, injustice, heartache, and loss, it conveys a strong message about courage, compassion, and historical awareness essential for personal growth.",

While primarily identifying with her father and older brother, Scout provides insight into the range of female characters in the novel from both an insider and outsider perspective. Her main female role models are Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, who are all independent, strong-willed, and protective figures. Additionally, Mayella Ewell has a significant impact; Scout observes her falsely accusing an innocent man to conceal her attraction towards him. The women most critical of Scout's reluctance to conform to traditional feminine roles often uphold racist and classist views. For instance, Mrs. Dubose criticizes Scout for not wearing dresses and camisoles, claiming she is tarnishing the family reputation while also disparaging Atticus' defense of Tom Robinson. By weighing the masculine influences from Atticus and Jem against the feminine guidance from Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar suggests that Lee subtly illustrates Scout's emerging feminism in the South. Through first-person narration, Lee reveals Scout/Jean Louise retains her childhood ambivalence toward being a Southern lady.",

This device harnessed reflected solar energy to heat containers filled with ether—boiling at a lower temperature than water—through internal black pipes, thus driving a steam engine.\n\nBy 1908, Shuman established the Sun Power Company to build larger-scale solar power plants. Collaborating with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, they improved the system by using mirrors to concentrate solar energy on collector boxes for water heating instead of ether.\n\nSubsequently, Shuman designed a full-scale steam engine utilizing low-pressure heated water, leading him to secure a patent for the entire solar engine system in 1912.",

The Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA, was the first major commercial implementation, using 114 parabolic dishes to meet half of a clothing factory's heating, air conditioning, and electrical needs. This project featured a grid-connected cogeneration system that generated 400 kW of electricity alongside thermal energy with outputs including 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, as well as one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow basins designed to concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. Historically utilized for extracting salt from seawater, they represented an early use of solar energy. Today, they serve to concentrate brine solutions in leach mining and remove dissolved solids from waste streams. Clotheslines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks enable garments to dry naturally using wind and sunlight without electricity or gas; some U.S. states have enacted legislation protecting this \"right to dry.\" Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated walls facing the sun that preheat ventilation air, raising incoming air temperatures by up to 22 °C (40 °F), with outlet temperatures ranging from 45–60 °C (113–140 °F).

To mitigate UHI effects, strategies such as applying reflective coatings to buildings and roads, along with increasing tree planting, can be employed. A \"cool communities\" initiative in Los Angeles suggests that these methods could potentially decrease urban temperatures by about 3°C at an estimated cost of US$1 billion. This program forecasts annual savings of approximately US$530 million through lowered air conditioning costs and reduced healthcare expenses.",

Additionally, it draws from social sciences to explore the organization of human social and cultural relations, institutions, and social conflicts.

By studying cultural traditions (time-focused) alongside cultural regions (space-focused), anthropologists have devised various comparative techniques that are crucial to their field.",
